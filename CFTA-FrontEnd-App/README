A front-end for the CFTA server that handles the incoming HTTP
requests and performs content fetching, extraction and text
analysis tasks using other CFTA libraries. Uses Spark web
framework (http://www.sparkjava.com/) for web request parsing
and handling. For compiling the front-end, you need to first
compile all other CFTA back-end sub-projects and then download
and include Stanford CoreNLP to be able to run CFTA-FrontEnd:
