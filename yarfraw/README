RSS feed reader for parsing RSS feeds. Code is forked from
yarfraw project (http://yarfraw.sourceforge.net/). It is 
slightly modified to support parsing the feeds directly from strings
as well as fetching the RSS feed using CFTA-Lib-WebFetch.

For easy parsing of RSS feeds, preferable solution is to
use CFTA-Lib-RSSFeedFetcher that in turn uses yarfraw for specific
parsing tasks.
