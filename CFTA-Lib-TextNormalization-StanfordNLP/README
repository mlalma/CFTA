A library for doing text analysis and normalization using Stanford's
CoreNLP natural language processing library. The library uses 
CoreNLP 3.3.1 and the .jar files are too large to be included in
this project. Download them directly from Stanford CoreNLP web
pages and include them to the project:

The source for CoreNLP is also available on GitHub:
