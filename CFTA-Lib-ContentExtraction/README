A library for extracting content from web pages.
Includes algoritms for extracting title, main image(s)
and the core text from the web page. For text extraction,
the library uses Boilerpipe library 
(https://code.google.com/p/boilerpipe/), but the upcoming
Xtract algorithm will handle all parts of content extraction
using custom web page renderer.
