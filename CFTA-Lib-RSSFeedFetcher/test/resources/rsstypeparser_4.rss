				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/28/nasty-facetime-bug-could-allows-others-to-eavesdrop-on-your-microphone-or-camera/">a bug was found in FaceTime</a> that could let others listen in to your Apple device&#8217;s microphone (or, in specific cases, view video from the camera) <em>without</em> you accepting the FaceTime call.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> disabled the Group FaceTime feature that enabled this bug server-side, thus preventing its future misuse while they worked on a proper patch. Apple says that patch should land later this week, but it sounds like that won&#8217;t be the end of it for the company.</p>
<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James and Governor Andrew Cuomo have just announced their intent to investigate the matter — how it happened, and what they call Apple&#8217;s &#8220;slow response&#8221;.</p>
<p>While Apple responded with its temporary fix once the bug started going viral, reports suggest that at least two users — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/technology/facetime-glitch-apple.html">a 14-year-old from Arizona and his mother</a>  — had been trying to no avail to warn Apple of this matter for over a week prior.</p>
<p>While bugs happen, this is a particularly egregious and mystifying one. It&#8217;s like the perfect storm of bugs — there&#8217;s the bug that turns on the microphone early, then a second stage of the bug that for some logic-defying reason <em>turns on the camera</em> if the call recipient hits the power button to try to decline the call. Then it slipped through QA. Then, finally, it gets noticed by someone with good intentions who tries <em>many ways</em> to bring it to Apple&#8217;s attention, unsuccessfully. It slowly spreads from person to person, then goes viral on Twitter. This is the kind of bug that people will be reading about in their software engineering textbooks for years.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Apple for comment on the investigation but none was given at the time of publishing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spin, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/07/ford-buys-electric-scooter-startup-spin/">electric scooter company recently bought by Ford</a>, still won&#8217;t be able to operate in San Francisco. Well, at least for now. This comes after Spin appealed the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency&#8217;s decision regarding electric scooter permits in the city. A neutral officer, James Doyle, has since denied Spin&#8217;s appeal.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The SFMTA is pleased the hearing officer validated our permitting process, which above all, prioritized the public interest,&#8221; SFMTA Communications Manager Ben Jose said in a statement to TechCrunch. &#8220;The SFMTA developed a fair, thoughtful and transparent permit program. Permits were awarded to the companies with the best applications that demonstrated a commitment to operating a safe, equitable and accountable service.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is, however, a silver lining for Spin. The hearing officer recommends the SFMTA consider having Spin participate in the second half of the one-year pilot program. That&#8217;s because &#8220;Spin appears to be an experienced and capable operator, and because allowing additional operators will enhance the probability of success of the powered e-scooter share program in San Francisco,&#8221; Doyle wrote in his decision.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/13/what-to-expect-from-the-return-of-electric-scooters-in-sf/embed/#?secret=hph1jRmUru" data-secret="hph1jRmUru" width="800" height="450" title="&#8220;Electric scooters are back in SF&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Citing Section 916 of the electric scooter program, which states that after the initial six-month period, the SFMTA may evaluate those with permits and reassess compliance, Doyle says that provides a &#8220;natural juncture&#8221; in the program. After the first six months of the program, the SFMTA can potentially increase the number of scooters from the current max of 625 to 2,500. This juncture, Doyle said, should be able to accommodate the addition of other operators.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were heartened by the Hearing Officer’s strong recommendation that Spin be granted a permit by the SFMTA at the six-month mark of the pilot,&#8221; a Spin spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. &#8220;While it’s disappointing that Spin can’t immediately serve our hometown, we appreciate the Hearing Officer’s acknowledgment of our experience and capabilities, and we look forward to working with the SFMTA to serve more San Franciscans with an alternative mobility mode and hire locally from the community.”</p>
<p>Currently, Skip and Scoot are the only two companies permitted to operate electric scooters in SF. Since deploying their respective fleets in October, both have experienced some growing pains &#8212; mostly pertaining to theft and vandalism. That has led both Scoot and Skip to add locks to their fleets.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In response to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/">TechCrunch&#8217;s investigation of Facebook paying teens and adults to install a VPN</a> that lets it analyze all their phone&#8217;s traffic, Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) has sent a letter to Mark Zuckerberg. It admonishes Facebook for not spelling out exactly what data the Facebook Research app was collecting or giving users adequate information necessary to determine if they should accept payment in exchange for selling their privacy. Following our report, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/apple-bans-facebook-vpn/">Apple banned Facebook&#8217;s Research app</a> from iOS and shut down its internal employee-only workplace apps too as punishment, causing mayhem in Facebook&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>Warner wrote to Zuckerberg, &#8220;In both the case of Onavo and the Facebook Research project, I have concerns that users were not appropriately informed about the extent of Facebook’s data-gathering and the commercial purposes of this data collection. Facebook’s apparent lack of full transparency with users – particularly in the context of ‘research’ efforts – has been a source of frustration for me,”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bnFZbilouE"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/">Facebook pays teens to install VPN that spies on them</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/embed/#?secret=bnFZbilouE" data-secret="bnFZbilouE" width="800" height="450" title="&#8220;Facebook pays teens to install VPN that spies on them&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Warner is working on writing new laws to govern data collection initiatives like Facebook Research. He asks Zuckerberg, &#8220;Will you commit to supporting legislation requiring individualized, informed consent in all instances of behavioral and market research conducted by large platforms on users?&#8221;</p>
<h2>Senator Blumenthal&#8217;s Fierce Statement</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, <span class="s1">Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) provided TechCrunch with a fiery statement regarding our investigation. He calls Facebook anti-competitive, which could fuel calls to regulate or break up Facebook, says the FTC must address the issue, and that he&#8217;s planning to work with congress to safeguard teens&#8217; privacy:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">“Wiretapping teens is not research, and it should never be permissible. This is yet another astonishing example of Facebook’s complete disregard for data privacy and eagerness to engage in anti-competitive behavior. Instead of learning its lesson when it was caught spying on consumers using the supposedly ‘private’ Onavo VPN app, Facebook rebranded the intrusive app and circumvented Apple’s attempts to protect iPhone users. Facebook continues to demonstrate its eagerness to look over everyone’s shoulder and watch everything they do in order to make money. </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Mark Zuckerberg’s empty promises are not enough. The FTC needs to step up to the plate, and the Onavo app should be part of its investigation. I will also be writing to Apple and Google on Facebook’s egregious behavior, and working in Congress to make sure that teens are protected from Big Tech’s privacy intrusions.”</span></em></p>
<h2>Senator Markey Says Stop Surveiling Teens</h2>
<p>And finally, Senator Edward J. Markey (D-MA) requests that Facebook stop recruiting teens for its Research program and notes he&#8217;ll push his &#8220;Do Not Track Kids&#8221; act in congress:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>“It is inherently manipulative to offer teens money in exchange for their personal information when younger users don’t have a clear understanding how much data they’re handing over and how sensitive it is. I strongly urge Facebook to immediately cease its recruitment of teens for its Research Program and explicitly prohibit minors from participating. Congress also needs to pass legislation that updates children’s online privacy rules for the 21st century. I will be reintroducing my ‘Do Not Track Kids Act’ to update the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act by instituting key privacy safeguards for teens. </em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>But my concerns also extend to adult users. I am alarmed by reports that Facebook is not providing participants with complete information about the extent of the information that the company can access through this program. Consumers deserve simple and clear explanations of what data is being collected and how it being used.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The Senators&#8217; statements do go a bit overboard. Though Facebook Research was aggressively competitive and potentially misleading, Blumenthal calling it &#8220;anti-competitive&#8221; is a stretch. And Warner&#8217;s questioning on whether &#8220;any user reasonably understood that they were giving Facebook root device access through the enterprise certificate&#8221; or that it uses the data to track competitors oversteps the bounds. Surely some savvy technologists did, but the question is whether <em>all</em> the teens and everyone else understood.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="i5TDmipBSd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/apple-bans-facebook-vpn/">Apple bans Facebook&#8217;s Research app that paid users for data</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/apple-bans-facebook-vpn/embed/#?secret=i5TDmipBSd" data-secret="i5TDmipBSd" width="800" height="450" title="&#8220;Apple bans Facebook&#8217;s Research app that paid users for data&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Facebook isn&#8217;t the only one paying users to analyze all their phone data. TechCrunch found that Google had a similar program called Screenwise Meter. Though it was more upfront about it, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/googles-also-peddling-a-data-collector-through-apples-back-door/">Google also appears to have violated Apple&#8217;s employee-only Enterprise Certificate rules</a>. We may be seeing the start to an industry-wide crack down on market research surveillance apps that dangle gift cards in front of users to get them to give up a massive amount of privacy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Warner&#8217;s full letter to Zuckerberg can be found below:</em></strong></p>
<p class="m_993678115188261330wordsection1"><i>Dear Mr. Zuckerberg:<u></u><u></u></i><i><u></u> <u></u></i></p>
<p class="m_993678115188261330wordsection1"><i>I write to express concerns about allegations of Facebook’s latest efforts to monitor user activity. On January 29th, TechCrunch revealed that under the auspices of partnerships with beta testing firms, Facebook had begun paying users aged 13 to 35 to install an enterprise certificate, allowing Facebook to intercept all internet traffic to and from user devices.  According to subsequent reporting by TechCrunch, Facebook relied on intermediaries that often “did not disclose Facebook’s involvement until users had begun the signup process.” Moreover, the advertisements used to recruit participants and the “Project Disclosure” make no mention of Facebook or the commercial purposes to which this data was allegedly put.<u></u><u></u></i></p>
<p class="m_993678115188261330wordsection1"><i>This arrangement comes in the wake of revelations that Facebook had previously engaged in similar efforts through a virtual private network (VPN) app, Onavo, that it owned and operated. According to a series of articles by the Wall Street Journal, Facebook used Onavo to scout emerging competitors by monitoring user activity – acquiring competitors in order to neutralize them as competitive threats, and in cases when that did not work, monitor usage patterns to inform Facebook’s own efforts to copy the features and innovations driving adoption of competitors’ apps.  In 2017, my staff contacted Facebook with questions about how Facebook was promoting Onavo through its Facebook app – in particular, framing the app as a VPN that would “protect” users while omitting any reference to the main purpose of the app: allowing Facebook to gather market data on competitors.<u></u><u></u></i></p>
<p class="m_993678115188261330wordsection1"><i>Revelations in 2017 and 2018 prompted Apple to remove Onavo from its App Store in 2018 after concluding that the app violated its terms of service prohibitions on monitoring activity of other apps on a user’s device, as well as a requirement to make clear what user data will be collected and how it will be used. In both the case of Onavo and the Facebook Research project, I have concerns that users were not appropriately informed about the extent of Facebook’s data-gathering and the commercial purposes of this data collection.<u></u><u></u></i></p>
<p class="m_993678115188261330wordsection1"><i>Facebook’s apparent lack of full transparency with users – particularly in the context of ‘research’ efforts – has been a source of frustration for me. As you recall, I wrote the Federal Trade Commission in 2014 in the wake of revelations that Facebook had undertaken a behavioral experiment on hundreds of thousands of users, without obtaining their informed consent. In submitted questions to your Chief Operating Officer, Sheryl Sandberg, I once again raised these concerns, asking if Facebook provided for “individualized, informed consent” in all research projects with human subjects – and whether users had the ability to opt out of such research. In response, we learned that Facebook does not rely on individualized, informed consent (noting that users consent under the terms of the general Data Policy) and that users have no opportunity to opt out of being enrolled in research studies of their activity.  In large part for this reason, I am working on legislation to require individualized, informed consent in all instances of behavioral and market research conducted by large platforms on users.</i><i> <u></u></i></p>
<p class="m_993678115188261330wordsection1"><i>Fair, robust competition serves as an impetus for innovation, product differentiation, and wider consumer choice. For these reasons, I request that you respond to the following questions:<u></u><u></u></i><i><u></u> <u></u></i></p>
<p class="m_993678115188261330wordsection1"><u></u><i>1.      </i><u></u><i>Do you think any user reasonably understood that they were giving Facebook root device access through the enterprise certificate? What specific steps did you take to ensure that users were properly informed of this access? <u></u><u></u></i></p>
<p class="m_993678115188261330wordsection1"><u></u><i>2.      </i><u></u><i>Do you think any user reasonably understood that Facebook was using this data for commercial purposes, including to track competitors?<u></u><u></u></i></p>
<p class="m_993678115188261330wordsection1"><u></u><i>3.      </i><u></u><i>Will you release all participants from the confidentiality agreements Facebook made them sign?<u></u><u></u></i></p>
<p class="m_993678115188261330wordsection1"><u></u><i>4.      </i><u></u><i>As you know, I have begun working on legislation that would require large platforms such as Facebook to provide users, on a continual basis, with an estimate of the overall value of their data to the service provider. In this instance, Facebook seems to have developed valuations for at least some uses of the data that was collected (such as market research). This further emphasizes the need for users to understand fully what data is collected by Facebook, the full range of ways in which it is used, and how much it is worth to the company. Will you commit to supporting this legislation and exploring methods for valuing user data holistically?<u></u><u></u></i></p>
<p class="m_993678115188261330wordsection1"><u></u><i>5.      </i><u></u><i>Will you commit to supporting legislation requiring individualized, informed consent in all instances of behavioral and market research conducted by large platforms on users?<u></u><u></u></i></p>
<p class="m_993678115188261330wordsection1"><i>I look forward to receiving your responses within the next two weeks. If you should have any questions or concerns, please contact my office at 202-224-2023.</i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You may think that the worst you&#8217;ll risk by buying a bargain-bin smart bulb or security camera will be a bit of extra trouble setting it up or a lack of settings. But it&#8217;s not just while they&#8217;re plugged in that these slapdash gadgets are a security risk — even from the garbage can, they can still compromise your network.</p>
<p>Although these so-called internet of things gadgets are small and rather dumb, they&#8217;re still full-fledged networked computers for all intents and purposes. They may not need to do much, but they still need to take many of the same basic precautions to prevent them from, say, broadcasting your private information unencrypted to the world, or granting root access to anyone walking by.</p>
<p>In the case of these low-cost &#8220;smart&#8221; bulbs<a href="https://limitedresults.com/2019/01/pwn-the-lifx-mini-white/"> investigated by Limited Results</a> (via <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/01/29/dont-toss-that-bulb-it-knows-your-password/">Hack a Day</a>), the issue isn&#8217;t what they do <em>while</em> connected but what they keep onboard their tiny brains, and how.</p>
<p>All the bulbs they tested proved to have no real security at all protecting the information kept on the chips inside. After exposing the PCBs, they attached a few leads and in a moment each device would spit out its boot data and be ready to take commands.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bulb_paper.jpg"><img class="vertical alignright wp-image-1776725" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bulb_paper.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="474" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bulb_paper.jpg 1318w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bulb_paper.jpg?resize=111,150 111w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bulb_paper.jpg?resize=222,300 222w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bulb_paper.jpg?resize=768,1040 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bulb_paper.jpg?resize=502,680 502w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bulb_paper.jpg?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a>The data was without exception totally unencrypted, including the wireless password to the network to which the device had been connected. One device also exposed its private RSA key, used to create secure connections to whatever servers it connects to (for example to check for updates, upload user data to the cloud, and so on). This information would be available to anyone who grabbed this bulb out of the trash, or stole it from an outdoor fixture, or bought it secondhand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seriously, 90 percent of IoT devices are developed without security in mind. It is just a disaster,&#8221; wrote Limited Results in an email. &#8220;In my research, I have targeted four different devices : LIFX, XIAOMI, TUYA and WIZ (not published yet, very unkind people). Same devices, same vulnerabilities, and even sometimes exactly same code inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, these particular bits of information exposed on these devices aren&#8217;t that harmful in and of themselves, although if someone wanted to, they could take advantage of it in several ways. What&#8217;s important to note is the utter lack of care that went into these devices — not just their code, but their construction. They really are just basic enclosures around an off-the-shelf wireless board, with no consideration given to safety, security, or longevity. And this type of thing is not by any means limited to smart bulbs.</p>
<p>These devices all proudly assert that they support Alexa, Google Home, or other standards. This may give users a false sense that they are in some way accredited, inspected, or otherwise held to basic standards.</p>
<p>In fact, in addition to all of them having essentially no security at all, one had its (conductive) metal shell insulated from the PCB only by a loose piece of adhesive paper. This kind of thing is an electrical fire or at least a short waiting to happen.</p>
<p>As with any other class of electronics, there&#8217;s always a pretty good reason why one is a whole lot cheaper than another. But in the case of a cheap CD player, the worst you&#8217;re going to get is skipping or a scratched disc. That&#8217;s <em>not</em> the case with a cheap baby monitor, a cheap smart outlet, a cheap internet-connected door lock.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying you need to buy the premium version of every smart gadget out there — consumers need to be aware of the risks they are exposing themselves to with the installation of any such device, let alone a poorly made one.</p>
<p>If you want to limit your own risk, a simple step you can take is to have your smart home devices and such isolated on a subnet or guest network. Making sure that the devices and of course your router are password protected, and take common sense measures like changing that password regularly.</p>

<p>Xbox Live outages happen from time to time, but it&#8217;s quite unusual for said outages to keep the entire console from booting. In most cases, the console would just boot and then fail to access online services. This has lead many to assume that their console, itself, had somehow broken — but, at least hopefully, they&#8217;ll boot right up once Microsoft untangles this mess of an outage.</p>
<p>Some users who are on wired connections report that their consoles boot up after the Ethernet cable is unplugged. Others on wireless connections say turning off their routers (so the Xbox doesn&#8217;t try to connect to Live over Wi-Fi) let them boot up.</p>
<p>Many reports say that factory resetting <strong>does not help</strong>, so don&#8217;t trouble yourself with that.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Microsoft&#8217;s Mike Ybarra blames the issue on a &#8220;deployment error&#8221; (meaning they went to push some new code, and something broke along the way), and says rebooting your console &#8220;in a few minutes&#8221; <em>should</em> fix it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Turns out training a robotic arm to play Jenga is a surprisingly complex task. There are, so to speak, a lot of moving parts. Researchers at MIT are putting a modified ABB IRB 120 to work with the familiar tabletop game, utilizing a soft gripper, force-sensing wrist joint and external camera to design a bot that can remove a block without toppling the tower. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The robot was trained with 300 attempts, rather than the thousands it would traditionally take, learning to cluster different attempts into groups as a kind of shorthand similar to how humans teach themselves. With each attempt the robot is pushing against the block, testing for tactile feedback to determine whether it’s a safe bet.</span></p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/o1j_amoldMs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Unlike in more purely cognitive tasks or games such as chess or Go, playing the game of Jenga also requires mastery of physical skills such as probing, pushing, pulling, placing and aligning pieces. It requires interactive perception and manipulation, where you have to go and touch the tower to learn how and when to move blocks,” says MIT assistant professor Alberto Rodriguez. “This is very difficult to simulate, so the robot has to learn in the real world, by interacting with the real Jenga tower. The key challenge is to learn from a relatively small number of experiments by exploiting common sense about objects and physics.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The robot has gotten pretty good at making attempts, but the team is quick to note that it’s not quite ready to take on experienced players. Among other things, the robot isn’t able to determine strategic blocks that can sabotage the tower’s strength for upcoming turns. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.rigetti.com/">Rigetti Computing</a>, one of the leading startups in the quantum computing space, today announced the public beta of its <a href="https://www.rigetti.com/qcs">Quantum Cloud Services</a> (QCS) platform. With this, developers can get access to Rigetti&#8217;s quantum processors, as well as all the classical computing resources necessary to build and test quantum algorithms on this hybrid platform.</p>
<p>Beta users will get $5,000 in credits toward running their programs on the platform. The platform itself consists of classical computing resources (you still need those as the quantum chips are essentially specialized co-processors) and Rigetti&#8217;s quantum chips, including two of its latest Aspen quantum processors. In order to run your algorithms on those chips, you&#8217;ll have to book time using the service&#8217;s online booking system.</p>
<p><img class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1776609" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1_1DZq9hYl5t2LTuW6tsNVOQ.png" alt="" width="1000" height="771" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1_1DZq9hYl5t2LTuW6tsNVOQ.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1_1DZq9hYl5t2LTuW6tsNVOQ.png?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1_1DZq9hYl5t2LTuW6tsNVOQ.png?resize=300,231 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1_1DZq9hYl5t2LTuW6tsNVOQ.png?resize=768,592 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1_1DZq9hYl5t2LTuW6tsNVOQ.png?resize=680,524 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1_1DZq9hYl5t2LTuW6tsNVOQ.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The core of the user experience, though, is Rigetti&#8217;s <a href="https://medium.com/rigetti/meet-your-quantum-machine-image-7b2828ae5bdc">Quantum Machine Image</a>, which features all of the company&#8217;s tools for building quantum algorithms, including its <a href="https://www.rigetti.com/forest">Forest SDK</a> and a simulator for testing code. That image then runs on a regular server in Rigetti&#8217;s cloud, but it&#8217;s tightly coupled with the company&#8217;s quantum computing resources.</p>
<p>Developers also get access to the first set of quantum applications written by various Rigetti partners, like <a href="https://zapatacomputing.com/">Zapata Computing</a>, a company that specializes in algorithms for quantum computing. Those applications range from a tool for compressing quantum data to QuantumFreeze to some basic machine learning applications. There&#8217;s also a game where you help a penguin navigate a frozen lake that&#8217;s pocketed with holes. You can either make classical moves or split the penguin into a superposition of states. Why not, I guess.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It looks like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/">Facebook</a> is not the only one abusing Apple&#8217;s system for distributing employee-only apps to sidestep the App Store and collect extensive data on users. Google has been running an app called <a href="https://support.google.com/audiencemeasurement/answer/7573812?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=7574346">Screenwise Meter</a>, which bears a strong resemblance to the app distributed by Facebook Research that has now been barred by Apple, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>In its app, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> invites users aged 18 and up (or 13 if part of a family group) to download the app by way of a special code and registration process using an Enterprise Certificate. That&#8217;s the same type of policy violation that led Apple to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/apple-bans-facebook-vpn/">shut down Facebook&#8217;s similar Research VPN iOS app</a>, which had the knock-on effect of also disabling usage of Facebook&#8217;s legitimate employee-only apps — which run on the same Facebook Enterprise Certificate — and making Facebook look very iffy in the process.</p>
<div id="attachment_1776676" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="breakout wp-image-1776676 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/google-certs1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="511" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/google-certs1.png 1400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/google-certs1.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/google-certs1.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/google-certs1.png?resize=768,383 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/google-certs1.png?resize=680,339 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/google-certs1.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Google&#8217;s Screenwise Meter app for iPhones (Images: Google)</p></div>
<p>First <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/08/google-offers-to-pay-for-people-to-have-their-web-use-tracked-minutely/">launched in 2012</a>, Screenwise lets users <a href="https://support.google.com/audiencemeasurement/answer/7689542?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=7648088">earn gift cards</a> for sideloading an Enterprise Certificate-based VPN app that allows Google to monitor and analyze their traffic and data. Google has rebranded the program as part of the Cross Media Panel and <a href="https://surveys.google.com/google-opinion-rewards/audience-measurement/">Google Opinion Rewards programs</a> that reward users for installing tracking systems on their mobile phone, PC web browser, router and TV. In fact, <a href="https://support.google.com/audiencemeasurement/answer/7574391?hl=en">Google actually sends participants a special router</a> that it can monitor.</p>
<p>Originally, Screenwise was open to users as young as 13, just like Facebook&#8217;s Research app that&#8217;s now been shut down on iOS but remains on Android. Now, according to the site&#8217;s <a href="https://support.google.com/audiencemeasurement/answer/7566134?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=7563962">Panelist Eligibility</a> rules, Google requires the primary users of its Opinion Rewards to be 18 or older, but still allows secondary panelists as young as 13 in the same household to join the program and have their devices tracked, as demonstrated in this video here (which was created in August of last year, underscoring that the program is still active):</p>

<p>Unlike Facebook, Google is much more upfront about how its research data collection programs work, what&#8217;s collected and that it&#8217;s directly involved. It also gives users the option of &#8220;<a href="https://support.google.com/audiencemeasurement/answer/7568157?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=7648088">guest mode</a>&#8221; for when they don&#8217;t want traffic monitored, or someone younger than 13 is using the device.</p>
<p>Putting the not-insignificant issues of privacy aside &#8212; in short, many people lured by financial rewards may not fully take in what it means to have a company fully monitoring all your screen-based activity &#8212; and the implications of what extent tech businesses are willing to go to to amass more data about users to get an edge on competitors, Google Screenwise Meter for iOS appears to violate Apple&#8217;s policy.</p>
<p>This states, in essence, that the Enterprise Certificate program for distributing apps without the App Store or Apple&#8217;s oversight is only for internal employee-only apps.</p>
<p>Google walks users through how to install the Enterprise Certificate and VPN on their phone. Developers seeking to do external testing on iOS are supposed to use the TestFlight system that sees apps reviewed and limits their distribution to 10,000 people.</p>

<p>We have reached out both to Apple and Google for a comment on why this app is either the same, or different from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/">the app Facebook had been distributing</a>.</p>
<p>If Apple considers this a violation of its Enterprise Certificate policy, it could shut down Screenwise&#8217;s ability to run on iOS. And if it truly wanted to punish Google like it did Facebook, it could invalidate the certifications for all of Google&#8217;s legitimate apps that run using the same certificate.</p>
<p>That could throw a wrench into Google&#8217;s product development and daily work flow that could be more damaging than just removing one way it gathers competitive intelligence.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll update this post as we learn more.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Free TV and movie streaming service <a href="https://tubitv.com/">Tubi</a> is preparing to double down on content acquisitions this year, the company announced this morning. The service today offers over 12,000 movies and TV series, totaling 40,000 hours of content. All of this can be streamed for free as the content is paid for not via customer subscriptions, but rather by advertising. Now the company is preparing to invest more than $100 million to expand its library this year, after hitting profitability in Q4 2018, and tackle new markets.</p>
<p>Founded in 2014, Tubi has benefited from the trend toward cord cutting, as well as the increasing number of younger consumers who never opt to pay for cable or satellite TV in the first place &#8212; sometimes called the &#8220;cord nevers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company claims that its viewership increased by more than 4.3 times from December 2017 to December 2018, which allowed it to hit the profitability milestone. In the fourth quarter alone, it saw more revenue than in all of 2017 combined, it also noted. And it grew revenues by 180+ percent in 2018.</p>
<p>On the advertising front, the company says it ran campaigns from more than 1,000 advertisers in 2018, including those from the majority of the top CPG and automotive companies.</p>
<p>However, several aspects of Tubi&#8217;s business aren&#8217;t being disclosed alongside today&#8217;s news &#8212; only the highlights. What the company won&#8217;t say is how many monthly active users it has, how many hours they watch or how many ad impressions take place across its platform. These sorts of metrics are critical to measuring success in ad-supported video.</p>
<p>According to estimates from Sensor Tower, Tubi has close to 51 million installs on mobile, with 1.7 million of those coming in December 2018, a 21 percent year-over-year increase. That could indicate that Tubi&#8217;s viewership growth is largely taking place on other platforms &#8212; like TVs through media players or deals with service providers, like Comcast, for instance.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1776624" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tubi-tv-homepage.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="594" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tubi-tv-homepage.png 1978w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tubi-tv-homepage.png?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tubi-tv-homepage.png?resize=300,262 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tubi-tv-homepage.png?resize=768,671 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tubi-tv-homepage.png?resize=680,594 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tubi-tv-homepage.png?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Along with its plans to grow its library, Tubi is preparing to expand outside the U.S. and Canada, with the first market launching this quarter.</p>
<p>To help fund its growth and content acquisitions, Tubi closed on $25 million in debt financing from Silicon Valley Bank in December.</p>
<p>These plans come at a time when Tubi&#8217;s business model has been seeing increased competition.</p>
<p>For example, Roku entered ad-supported programming with its own The Roku Channel <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/roku-launches-its-own-channel-featuring-free-ad-supported-movies/">launch</a> in fall 2017, and said earlier this month it now has <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-fire-tv-tops-30-million-active-users-beating-roku/">27 million</a> user accounts. Of course, Roku doesn&#8217;t break that down by how many use its platform for other services, versus those who specifically launch Roku&#8217;s own free content &#8212; but that is its ad-supported channel&#8217;s potential reach.</p>
<p>In addition to Roku, Tubi competes against Walmart&#8217;s ad-supported video on Vudu; Amazon-owned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/amazons-imdb-launches-a-free-streaming-service-freedive/">IMDb&#8217;s new service Freedive</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/22/viacom-buys-the-free-video-streaming-service-pluto-tv-for-340-million/">Viacom&#8217;s latest acquisition</a>, Pluto TV; Sinclair&#8217;s local broadcaster-focused service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/16/local-tv-broadcaster-sinclair-launches-stirr-a-free-streaming-service-with-local-news-and-sports/">Stirr</a>; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/plex-plans-to-offer-ad-supported-movies-and-more-premium-subscriptions/">soon</a>, Plex. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/14/nbcuniversal-announces-streaming-service-that-will-be-free-to-paid-tv-subscribers/">Comcast will also launch</a> a free streaming service for its pay TV customers in 2020.</p>
<p>Tubi, like many of these services, believes in its potential as consumers tire of being nickeled and dimed for video subscriptions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“In 2018 we at Tubi saw tremendous growth as consumers, fatigued by SVOD subscriptions and services, sought alternative entertainment choices,” said Farhad Massoudi, CEO of Tubi, in a statement. “We will continue to use profits to make bigger bets on content, enhance the viewing experience, and continue to press ahead into new grounds in what is our core advantage: technology and data,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1776671" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tubi-1-OTT-Home-Screen.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tubi-1-OTT-Home-Screen.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tubi-1-OTT-Home-Screen.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tubi-1-OTT-Home-Screen.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tubi-1-OTT-Home-Screen.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tubi-1-OTT-Home-Screen.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tubi-1-OTT-Home-Screen.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>In reality, however, Tubi competes for attention among a growing streaming market, which includes those paid subscription video offerings. Today&#8217;s consumers are building out customized bundles that make sense for them &#8212; a little Netflix and HBO perhaps, fleshed out with some free content through services like Tubi, for example.</p>
<p>Tubi&#8217;s advantage, of course, is that it doesn&#8217;t have to spend the billions on content and originals that subscription video services like Netflix do to win users. Instead, it relies on titles that have mainstream appeal, but may not be winning any awards &#8212; like older movies, kids shows, B-flicks, horror films and reality TV.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, however, Tubi won&#8217;t necessarily gain from people <em>tiring</em> of subscription video, but from the growing influx of cord cutters who are searching for older or niche content not included in subscription libraries &#8212; or who just want to watch a free movie.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Braving 20-degree weather, protesters crowded the steps of New York City Hall this morning with signs highlighting a “crumbling MTA” and rising tuition. Several held pro-union placards, while a man in a bright yellow warehouse vest claimed, “Amazon doesn’t let me pee.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This morning, New York’s City Council held a hearing examining Amazon’s proposed HQ2 in Long Island City. Titled “Does the Amazon Deal Deliver for New York City Residents?,” the hearing follows one held last month that focused on the closed-door proceedings that delivered Amazon’s bid to the industrial Queens neighborhood. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The second time around, the council promised to explore the tax incentives that made the deal possible, along with the potential impact such a move could have on the city, residents and infrastructure. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last year, New York was revealed to be one of two cities that would house a second headquarters for the retail giant. The other, Crystal City, North Virginia, approved $750 million in subsidies after a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-house-approves-750-million-in-amazon-subsidies-after-9-minutes-of-debate/2019/01/28/ac1a40ac-2334-11e9-90cd-dedb0c92dc17_story.html">brief debate earlier this week</a>.</span></p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1776605" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DyKs91TX0AADbeX-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DyKs91TX0AADbeX-1.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DyKs91TX0AADbeX-1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DyKs91TX0AADbeX-1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DyKs91TX0AADbeX-1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DyKs91TX0AADbeX-1.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DyKs91TX0AADbeX-1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The company has been subject to a larger pushback in New York, where rent prices and infrastructure are already feeling the strain of the city’s 8.6 million residents. Both the company and city officials came under scrutiny for backdoor dealings ahead of the official announcement. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“In this case, the deal was done backwards,” Speaker Corey Johnson said in his opening remarks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“The City and State made a deal with HQ2 in Long Island City and agreed to give away at least $3 billion in public subsidy before they did their due diligence.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Amazon Vice President of Public Policy Brian Huseman attended the hearing to represent<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>the retail giant’s position. “We believe our new headquarters should provide job opportunities for all New Yorkers,” he hold the Council. “Amazon’s investment in Long Island City will create 25,000 jobs over 10 years with an average salary of more than $150,000.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Huseman was also quick to cite plans this week to fund high school classes in the city and used the opportunity <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/amazon-partners-with-new-york-colleges-on-a-cloud-computing-job-training-program/">to announce</a> partnerships with LaGuardia Community College (LAGCC), the City University of New York (CUNY) and the State University of New York (SUNY), which would create a cloud computing certificate program for students. Both serve the clear function of demonstrating Amazon’s commitment to the community while providing a potential pipeline for future employees. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The site chosen for the office space, council members were quick to point out, was previously designated for two public schools, 5,000 units of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>affordable housing, parks and commercial space. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An upcoming hearing will feature statements from the community. For now, however, those who made it through the chamber doors were asked to sit quietly. The crowd largely heeded the warning, save for a few outbursts and the constant presence of bright orange handbills reading, “Caution: Amazon Lies,” along with a frowning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>face playing off the company’s familiar “A to Z” logo. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As Huseman delivered his opening remarks, twin black banners were unfurled from the balcony, claiming that “Amazon Delivers Lies” and “Supports Deportation.” Police escorted protesters out, before a third shouted complaints about Amazon’s union policies. He, too, was escorted out, as security issued a warning that any additional outbursts would force the balconies to be cleared.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1776606" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DyKsvIIWwAA-Enq.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DyKsvIIWwAA-Enq.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DyKsvIIWwAA-Enq.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DyKsvIIWwAA-Enq.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DyKsvIIWwAA-Enq.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DyKsvIIWwAA-Enq.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DyKsvIIWwAA-Enq.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Union policies were a recurring theme throughout. Council<span class="Apple-converted-space"> m</span>ember Daniel Dromm declared that “New York is a Union town,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>while Deputy Leader Jimmy Van Bremmer shamed the company for an anti-union stance. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Johnson pressed Huseman, asking whether the company would agree to remain neutral with regards to workers unionizing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>&#8220;No sir,” the executive answered. Pushed whether Amazon’s surveillance technology has been employed by agencies like ICE to deport immigrants, Huseman answered, &#8220;We cannot disclose who our customers are without their consent.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Huseman added that inclusion played a role in the company’s ultimate decision to settle in Queens. The borough is, notably, the most diverse county in the U.S. “We asked cities and locations to identity the diversity of the talent pool,” he told the council. “We are very excited about the diversity of the talent pool.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Amazon also conceded that tax incentives were one of several motivating factors in the decision. “Labor was the primary driver,” a representative said. “The cost of doing business was also a driver.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No date has been announced for the third hearing. </span></p>

<p><strong>1. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/apple-bans-facebook-vpn/">Apple bans Facebook’s Research app that paid users for data</a></strong></p>
<p>In the wake of TechCrunch’s investigation, Apple blocked Facebook’s Research VPN app before the social network could voluntarily shut it down.</p>
<p>The Research app asked users for root network access to all data passing through their phone in exchange for $20 per month. Apple says that yesterday evening, it revoked the Enterprise Certificate that allows Facebook to distribute the Research app without going through the App Store.</p>

<p>In 2017, Foxconn announced the largest investment of a foreign company in the United States when it selected Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin for a new manufacturing facility. In an interview with Reuters, a special assistant to Foxconn&#8217;s CEO says that those plans are being scaled back.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A day after Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/amazon-to-fund-computer-science-classes-in-over-130-nyc-high-schools/">detailed</a> plans to fund computer science classes in New York area high schools, in an effort to expand its tech pipeline for its new HQ2 location in Queens, the company this morning announced a second educational initiative that sees it teaming up with New York City and state colleges. Amazon says it will work with LaGuardia Community College (LAGCC), the City University of New York (CUNY) and the State University of New York (SUNY) to create a cloud computing certificate program for students across New York. The goal will be to get students ready for entry-level tech roles &#8212; like those at Amazon or elsewhere.</p>
<p>The program, which begins this fall, will be offered to the tens of thousands of students across these universities, Amazon says. In addition, LAGCC will partner with at least one New York City high school to offer concurrent enrollment in the 15-credit certificate program.</p>
<p>While the new high school courses are being funded through the <a href="https://www.amazonfutureengineer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cms-ai="0">Amazon Future Engineer</a> program, this certificate program for college students is being handled through Amazon&#8217;s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1548950632982000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFWJW0ihdF9KNhpIRzGyZ0w4hN5hw">AWS Educate program.</a> The Educate program is today being used by more than 1,500 institutions to train students in cloud computing by offering them hands-on experience in AWS technology. This skill can then be used to apply for jobs at Amazon and other companies.</p>
<p>The program includes curriculum development workshops and AWS trainings for faculty, while students receive free AWS Promotional Credits in order to perform their project assignments.</p>
<p>Another feature of the program is a job board that allows students to upload resumés, receive job alerts, connect with recruiters and search for cloud computing jobs and internships at Amazon and other tech companies.</p>
<p>Amazon notes cloud computing is one of the highest-paying IT jobs, but its goal here is not altruistic, of course. It&#8217;s prepping the tech talent pipeline to ensure its new NYC &#8220;HQ2&#8243; has room to grow. The company also adds that local demand for cloud computing talent will increase 17 percent by 2024, citing New York Department of Labor forecasts.</p>
<p>“As we continue to expand our presence in New York, we’re excited to work with the community to provide more opportunities for skills development,” said Ardine Williams, VP of Workforce Development at Amazon, in a statement about the program. “There is such rich talent in New York, and we want to ensure we’re reaching New Yorkers from diverse backgrounds, as we hire for 25,000 jobs across the region. We see this collaboration with LAGCC, CUNY, and SUNY as ensuring that more students have the opportunity to join companies like Amazon as we seek out more tech talent. This is the beginning of our workforce development efforts in New York – we’re looking forward to launching more initiatives to meet New Yorkers where they are, providing opportunities for new skill sets and even better paying jobs,&#8221; Williams said.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Well that didn’t last long.</p>
<p>In 2017, Foxconn announced the largest investment of a foreign company in the United States when <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-foxconn-wisconsin/foxconn-announces-u-s-manufacturing-plant-in-wisconsin-idUSKBN1AB258">it selected Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin for a new manufacturing facility</a>. Buttressed by huge economic development grants from Wisconsin, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-foxconn-facility/">an endorsement from President Trump</a>, and Foxconn CEO Terry Gou’s vision of a maker America, the plant was designed to turn a small town and its environs into the futuristic “<a href="https://wisconnvalley.wi.gov/Pages/Home.aspx">Wisconn Valley</a>.”</p>
<p>Now, those dreams are coming apart faster than you can say “Made in America.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-foxconn-wisconsin-exclusive/exclusive-foxconn-reconsidering-plans-to-make-lcd-panels-at-wisconsin-plant-idUSKCN1PO0FV">In an interview with Reuters</a>, a special assistant to Gou says that those plans are being remarkably scaled back. Originally designed to be an advanced LCD factory, the new Foxconn facility will instead be a much more modest (but still needed!) research center for engineers.</p>
<p>It’s a huge loss for Wisconsin, but the greater shock may be just how obvious all of this was. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/foxconn-or-foxgone-tariffs-wisconsin-and-iphone-fires/">I wrote about the boondoggle just a few weeks ago</a>, as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18027032/foxconn-wisconsin-plant-jobs-deal-subsidy-governor-scott-walker">had Bruce Murphy at The Verge a few weeks before that</a>. <a href="https://www.gimletmedia.com/reply-all/132-negative-mount-pleasant">Sruthi Pinnamaneni produced an excellent podcast on Reply All</a> about how much the economic development of Mount Pleasant tore the small town asunder.</p>
<p>The story in short: the economics of the factory never made sense, and economics was always going to win over the hopes and dreams of politicians like Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, who championed the deal. Despite bells and whistles, televisions are a commodity product (unlike, say, airfoils), and thus the cost structure is much more compatible with efficient Asian supply chains than with American expensive labor.</p>
<p>Yet, that wasn’t the only part of the project that never made any sense. Foxconn was building in what was essentially the middle of nowhere, without the sort of dense ecosystem of suppliers and sub-suppliers required for making a major factory hum. (Plus, as a native of Minnesota, I can also attest that Wisconsin is a pile of garbage).</p>
<p>Those suppliers are everything for manufacturers. Just this past weekend, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/technology/iphones-apple-china-made.html">Jack Nicas at the New York Times observed</a> that Apple’s advanced manufacturing facility in Austin, Texas struggled to find the right parts it needed to assemble its top-of-the-line computer, the Mac Pro:</p>
<blockquote><p>But when Apple began making the $3,000 computer in Austin, Tex., it struggled to find enough screws, according to three people who worked on the project and spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements.</p>
<p>In China, Apple relied on factories that can produce vast quantities of custom screws on short notice. In Texas, where they say everything is bigger, it turned out the screw suppliers were not.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are of course huge manufacturing ecosystems in the United States — everything from cars in Detroit, to planes in Washington, to advanced medical devices in several major bio-hubs. But consumer electronics is one that has for the most part been lost to Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, and of course, China.</p>
<p>Geopolitically, Foxconn’s factory made a modicum of sense. With the increasing protectionism emanating from Western capitals, Foxconn could have used some geographical diversity in the event of a tariff fight. The company is Taiwanese, but manufacturers many of its products on the mainland.</p>
<p>And of course, a research center is still an enormous gain for a region of Wisconsin that could absolutely use high-income, professional jobs. Maybe the process of rolling out a next-generation manufacturing ecosystem will take more time than originally anticipated, but nothing is stopping further expansion in the future.</p>
<p>Yet, one can’t help but gaze at the remarkable naïveté of Wisconsin politicians who offered billions only to find that even massive subsidies aren’t enough. It’s a competitive world out there, and the United States has little experience in these fights.</p>
<h2>India may put friction on foreign firms to protect domestic startups</h2>

(MONEY SHARMA/AFP/Getty Images)</p></div>
<p>One of the major battles for tech supremacy is over the future of the Indian IT market, which is rapidly bringing more than a billion people onto the internet and giving them robust software services. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/04/india-may-become-next-restricted-market-for-u-s-cloud-providers/">I’ve talked a bit about data sovereignty</a>, which mandates that Indian data be stored in Indian data centers by Indian companies, pushing out foreign companies like Amazon, Google, and Alibaba.</p>
<p>Now, it looks like India is taking a page from the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/four-asian-tigers.asp">Asian tiger</a>-school of development, and is going to increasingly favor domestic firms over foreign ones in key industries. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-amazon-walmart-and-other-foreign-players-dominate-india-to-promote-domestic-tech-companies-11548766862">Newley Purnell and Rajesh Roy report in the WSJ</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The secretary of India’s Telecommunications Department, Aruna Sundararajan, last week told a gathering of Indian startups in a closed-door meeting in the tech hub of Bangalore that the government will introduce a “national champion” policy “very soon” to encourage the rise of Indian companies, according to a person familiar with the matter. She said Indian policy makers had noted the success of China’s internet giants, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. , the person said. She didn’t immediately respond to a request for more details on the program or its timing.</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea of national champions is simple. Unlike the innovation world of Silicon Valley, there are obvious sectors in an economy that need to be fulfilled. Food and clothes have to be sold, deliveries made, all kinds of industrial goods need to be built. Rather than creating a competitive market that requires high levels of duplicate capital investment, the government can designate a few companies to take the lead in each market to ensure that they can invest for growth rather than in, say, marketing costs.</p>
<p>If done well, such policies can rapidly industrialize a country’s economic base. When done poorly, the lack of competition can create lethargy among entrepreneurs, who have already won their markets without even trying.</p>
<p>The linchpin is whether the government pushes companies to excel and sets aggressive growth targets. In Korea and China, the central governments actively monitored corporate growth during their catch-up years, and <a href="http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0195076036.001.0001/acprof-9780195076035">transferred businesses to new entrepreneurs if business leaders failed to perform</a>. Can India push its companies as hard without market forces?</p>
<p>As the technology industry matures in the West, entrepreneurs will look for overseas as their future growth hubs. The challenge is whether they will be let in at all.</p>
<h2>Video game geopolitics</h2>
<div id="attachment_1776563" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1776563" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/01.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/01.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/01.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/01.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/01.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/01.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/01.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Nexon&#8217;s MapleStory2 game is one of its most profitable (Screenshot from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nexon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nexon">Nexon) <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p></div>
<p>Korea and Japan are two of the epicenters of the video game industry, and now one of its top companies is on the auction block, raising tough questions about media ownership.</p>
<p>Nexon founder Kim Jung Ju <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/04/nexon-founder-sale/">announced a few weeks ago</a> that he was intending to sell all of his controlling $9 billion stake in the leading video game company. The company has since executed something of a multi-stage auction process to determine who should buy those shares. <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20190130000759">One leading candidate we’ve learned is Kakao</a>, the leading internet portal and chatting app in Korea.</p>
<p>The other leading candidate is China-based Tencent, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nexon-m-a-tencent-holdings/tencent-weighing-bid-for-holding-company-behind-koreas-nexon-sources-idUSKCN1PC14N">which owns exclusive distribution rights in China of some of Nexon’s most important titles</a>.</p>
<p>Tencent has been increasingly under the sway of China’s government, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/29/tencent-left-out-as-china-approves-the-release-of-80-new-video-games/">which froze video game licensing</a> last year as it worked to increase content regulation over the industry. Now the question is whether it will be politically palatable to sell a leading star of Korea’s video game industry to its economic rival.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d67522e4-245c-11e9-8ce6-5db4543da632">From the Financial Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr Wi added that Nexon would be an attractive target for Tencent, which pays about Won1tn in annual royalties to the South Korean game developer. But selling the company to Tencent would be “politically burdensome” for Mr Kim, given unfavourable public opinion in South Korea towards such a sale, he cautioned.</p>
<p>“Political risks are high for the deal. Being criticised for selling the company to a foreign rival, especially a Chinese one, would be the last thing that Mr Kim wants,” said Mr Wi.</p></blockquote>
<p>Such concerns around Chinese media ownership <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/07/china-plan-for-global-media-dominance-propaganda-xi-jinping">have become acute throughout the world</a>, but we haven’t seen these concerns as much in the video game industry. Clearly, times have changed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> could face fresh scrutiny in Europe following a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/"> TechCrunch report </a>on its use of a VPN app to monitor people&#8217;s smartphone activity &#8212; including teenagers as young as 13.</p>
<p>The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) told us it&#8217;s asked Facebook to provide more information on what data is collected via the market research program, codenamed &#8216;Project Atlas&#8217;, so that it can determine whether there are grounds for further investigation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Irish DPC only became aware of this story through this morning’s media reporting. Before we can make any assessment as to whether or not there are any data protection concerns, we will need to understand better to what extent, how and on what basis the personal data in question is being processed and used. We have asked Facebook to provide us with this information,&#8221; said the DPC&#8217;s head of communications, Graham Doyle.</p>
<p>Under European union law there are special requirements for processing minors&#8217; personal data. And, as we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/">reported earlier</a>, Facebook&#8217;s research program is open to people around the world &#8212; although the company has yet to confirm whether it has any teenage participants in Europe. (We&#8217;ve asked and will update this report with any response.)</p>
<p>If it turns out that European teens have been participating in the research effort Facebook could face another barrage of complaints under the bloc&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) &#8212; and the prospect of substantial fines if any local agencies determine it failed to live up to consent and &#8216;privacy by design&#8217; requirements baked into the bloc&#8217;s privacy regime. (Facebook&#8217;s international HQ is located in Ireland, which makes the Irish DPC the lead agency for any investigation of the project.)</p>
<h2>Less aware of the risks</h2>
<p>Setting out conditions applicable to consent for processing the personal data of children aged 13 or older, one section of text from the GDPR reads: &#8220;Children merit specific protection with regard to their personal data, as they may be less aware of the risks, consequences and safeguards concerned and their rights in relation to the processing of personal data.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Given that children merit specific protection, any information and communication, where processing is addressed to a child, should be in such a clear and plain language that the child can easily understand,&#8221; runs another.</p>
<p>The VPN app that Facebook has been using as a data-harvesting vehicle (since we reported on the story it&#8217;s closed down the iOS version of the app) requires participants give root access to their device &#8212; potentially affording the company a very high resolution view of their digital activity indeed.</p>
<p>According to an investigation we commissioned data continuously collected via the VPN app could include private messages in social media apps; chats from in instant messaging apps – including photos/videos sent to others; emails; web searches; web browsing activity; and ongoing location information.</p>
<p>Although Facebook has also not confirmed exactly what data types it pulls via the program.</p>
<p>Participants are offered payments of up to $20 (in e-gift tokens) to incentivize them to sign up to have their data harvested on an ongoing basis, with the program open to people aged 13-35.</p>
<p>Facebook says parental consent is required for minors aged 13-17. But it&#8217;s not clear how robust the company&#8217;s age verification process is &#8212; after BBC journalist Dave Lee reported being able to sign himself up to participate in Project Atlas, earlier today, as a &#8220;14-year-old boy&#8230; with two kids&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It required no proof of parental consent at all. I&#8217;ve just been sent a link to download the iOS app, &#8221; he added via Twitter.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I thought I&#39;d see how robust the parental control for Facebook&#39;s programme is. In less than five minutes I was able to sign up as a 14-year-old boy&#8230; with two kids. It required no proof of parental consent at all. I&#39;ve just been sent a link to download the iOS app. <a href="https://t.co/z6www8SgQJ">pic.twitter.com/z6www8SgQJ</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Dave Lee (@DaveLeeBBC) <a href="https://twitter.com/DaveLeeBBC/status/1090528627005902848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>So while Facebook previously told us less than 5% of the (unknown number of) participants in the research program are teens it&#8217;s not clear whether it can make that sort of assertion &#8212; or indeed put any verifiable figure on children&#8217;s participation in the program &#8212; if its age verification process fails at the first hurdle.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Facebook with questions and to the app testing companies it&#8217;s been working with to administer the program &#8212; namely <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/applause" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="applause">Applause/uTest <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and BetaBound &#8212; to ask how they verify the age of participants and how parental consents are collected. At the time of writing none had replied.</p>
<p>In an earlier statement, provided in response to our first report on Project Atlas, Facebook defended the initiative, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like many companies, we invite people to participate in research that helps us identify things we can be doing better. Since this research is aimed at helping Facebook understand how people use their mobile devices, we’ve provided extensive information about the type of data we collect and how they can participate. We don’t share this information with others and people can stop participating at any time.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Questions over verification</h2>
<p>Returning to the GDPR, Article 8 &#8212; which concerns conditions application to children&#8217;s consent for processing personal data &#8212; states data controllers must make &#8220;reasonable efforts&#8221; to verify consent when processing children&#8217;s personal data:</p>
<blockquote><p>The controller shall make reasonable efforts to verify in such cases that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child, taking into consideration available technology.</p></blockquote>
<p>And in further <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/children-and-the-gdpr/what-should-our-general-approach-to-processing-children-s-personal-data-be/">guidance</a> on conditions for processing children&#8217;s data, the UK&#8217;s data protection agency says &#8220;data protection by design and by default&#8221; must be the baseline.</p>
<p>&#8220;Transparency is also key,&#8221; it continues. &#8220;You can raise children’s (and their parents’) awareness of data protection risks, consequences, safeguards and rights by: Telling them what you are doing with their personal data; Being open about the risks and safeguards involved; and letting them know what to do if they are unhappy. This will also help them make informed decisions about what personal data they wish to share.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook has said parental consent forms were &#8220;signed&#8221; and also claims it provided &#8220;extensive information&#8221; about the data being collected. But plenty of questions remain over exactly how robustly it verified participants&#8217; ages; how parental consents were obtained; as well as the quality and accessibility of the information provided to parents and teens.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">One UK-based EU data protection expert we asked for a view, <a href="https://twitter.com/PrivacyMatters">Pat Walshe</a>, suggested the approach to consent described in the article would not pass muster under GDPR.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="iNMJGf8GWV"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/">Facebook pays teens to install VPN that spies on them</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As well as offering up to $20 a month in incentivize teens to sign away their privacy, Facebook&#8217;s program also included a referral scheme &#8212; which meant users could increase their &#8216;earnings&#8217; by recommending a friend &#8212; aping the <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8216;growth hacking&#8217; tactics deployed by app developers everywhere hoping to spark a viral run for their latest release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But a viral run on kids&#8217; privacy wouldn&#8217;t be at all cool.  </span></p>
<p>In instances where minors signed up to be watched by Facebook the program appears to have rewarded them for pestering their peers to do the same.</p>
<p>Yet an age verification system that can&#8217;t distinguish an adult male from a 14-year-old boy seems unlikely to be able to correctly identify a child younger than 13 who&#8217;s &#8212; say &#8212; pretending to be an adult in order to get some sweet e-gift rewards&#8230;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Another update relating to consent. FB statement said teens had provided parental consent before using the program. I asked FB what exactly that meant &#8211; signed form, scanned? &#8211; they said the vendors handled it. For at least one of the vendors, consent was basically a checkbox.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/09/children-are-being-datafied-before-weve-understood-the-risks-report-warns/">Last fall</a> the children&#8217;s commissioner for England published a report raising concerns about how extensively minors’ data is being collected and shared across the board, in both the private and public sectors, writing that: “Children and parents need to be much more aware of what they share and consider the consequences.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It has been just about a year since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/12/wework-labs-early-stage-startups-coworking-accelerator/">the relaunch of WeWork Labs</a>, an accelerator-type program operating under the WeWork umbrella. Since then, it has grown to <a href="https://www.wework.com/labs">37 locations in 22 cities</a>. And it&#8217;s truly international, operating in 12 countries, including Brazil, China, Germany and India.</p>
<p>These Labs offices are often — but not always — housed within a larger WeWork space, and, like an accelerator, they offer mentorship and programming. However, WeWork doesn&#8217;t take any equity; instead, it simply makes money by charging rent. (In New York, a desk costs between $450 and $550 a month, but the price varies by location.)</p>
<p>I spoke to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/roee-adler" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="roee-adler">Roee Adler, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the program&#8217;s global head, about how Labs has evolved over the past year. Adler actually has a long history with startups — in fact, his company Soluto <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/05/26/techcrunch-disrupt-winner-soluto/">won the very first Startup Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt</a>. He&#8217;s held a number of positions at WeWork, including chief product officer, and he said that as his role was evolving, he found himself asking, &#8220;What is the next startup we can build inside WeWork?&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer: &#8220;We decided to reevaluate our level of commitment and investment with the earliest of stages for startups.&#8221;</p>
<p>WeWork actually had a startup program called <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wework-labs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wework-labs">WeWork Labs <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> back in 2011, but it languished in the years since. Adler relaunched the program with its first New York space in January of last year, and he&#8217;s been opening locations at a furious pace since then.</p>
<div id="attachment_1776539" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1776539" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/20190124-WeWork-Labs-Pitch-Night-Teasers-12.jpg?w=680" alt="Roee Adler" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/20190124-WeWork-Labs-Pitch-Night-Teasers-12.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/20190124-WeWork-Labs-Pitch-Night-Teasers-12.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/20190124-WeWork-Labs-Pitch-Night-Teasers-12.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/20190124-WeWork-Labs-Pitch-Night-Teasers-12.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/20190124-WeWork-Labs-Pitch-Night-Teasers-12.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/20190124-WeWork-Labs-Pitch-Night-Teasers-12.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Roee Adler</p></div>
<p>Each Labs office is supervised by a Labs manager, who Adler said is usually &#8220;a former entrepreneur whose life&#8217;s mission is to manage startups.&#8221; For example, before <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mor-barak-69b67860/?originalSubdomain=il">Mor Barak</a> joined the program last year to launch Labs in Tel Aviv, she was the general manager of Israel&#8217;s oldest accelerator program, The Junction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got to a point where I felt like I finally found what I loved to do, which is to work with startups and to support startups and understand how our connections and our network can help them move forward,&#8221; Barak said. &#8220;And then I wanted to take that and do that on a bigger scale, as part of a company that can reach new geographies and bring forward local entrepreneurs.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a Labs manager, Barak said her main role is to &#8220;be that business connector for the startups,&#8221; which means meeting with the entrepreneurs on a weekly basis to understand their needs and challenges. At the same time, she emphasized that Labs is a global program: &#8220;As a Labs manager in Tel Aviv, I can quite easily connect to my colleagues around the world to find the people that I need to get to in order to help the startup.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adler made a similar point about sharing resources between the different locations.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lecture that is at our Najing Xi Lu Road space in Shanghai will get captured, summarized, translated and become available to all of the entrepreneurs around the world,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Does that mean every piece of information is relevant for everyone? No. But truthfully, who knows?&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_1776542" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1776542" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/20190124-WeWork-Labs-Pitch-Night-Teasers-30.jpg?w=680" alt="Adriana Vazquez of Lilu" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/20190124-WeWork-Labs-Pitch-Night-Teasers-30.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/20190124-WeWork-Labs-Pitch-Night-Teasers-30.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/20190124-WeWork-Labs-Pitch-Night-Teasers-30.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/20190124-WeWork-Labs-Pitch-Night-Teasers-30.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/20190124-WeWork-Labs-Pitch-Night-Teasers-30.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/20190124-WeWork-Labs-Pitch-Night-Teasers-30.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Adriana Vazquez of Lilu</p></div>
<p>To celebrate the one-year anniversary, WeWork Labs held a pitch competition at the company&#8217;s New York City headquarters last week, with $250,000 in funding distributed among the winners. The $150,000 grand prize went to <a href="https://www.wearlilu.com">Lilu</a>, a startup making a compression bra that helps mothers pump milk. (It&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/19/lilus-compression-bra-aims-to-help-nursing-mothers-pump-more-milk-faster/">another Startup Battlefield alum</a>.)</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Adriana Vazquez told me that Lilu has been working out of the WeWork Labs in Dumbo since August. Vazquez has participated in other accelerator programs and worked out of other co-working spaces, and she said Labs is something else — it allows you to &#8220;get the community of an accelerator without the prescribed schedule,&#8221; and it offers a very different feeling from a co-working space.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is that understanding and respect that everyone’s really busy and has fires to put out,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We had a brief stay at another co-working space with creatives and small businesses, and there wasn’t that camaraderie, where you see someone that’s working on a weekend and you know you&#8217;re not here because they want to hang out on a Friday. It&#8217;s almost an unspoken understanding: Yeah, I know what you&#8217;re going through.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for what Adler has planned for Labs&#8217; second year, he said he wants to do more work <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/wework-approach-assessing-new-business-line-ideas-setting-roee-adler/">connecting startups with larger corporations</a>: &#8220;WeWork has really become the only natural nexus in the world where you can have a three-month-old startup entrepreneur bumping shoulders with a senior vice president of Microsoft going to get coffee from the same machine and engaging in a conversation about the future.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_1776545" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-1776545" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/WeWork_Labs_Dumbo-5.jpg?w=680" alt="WeWork Labs Dumbo" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/WeWork_Labs_Dumbo-5.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/WeWork_Labs_Dumbo-5.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/WeWork_Labs_Dumbo-5.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/WeWork_Labs_Dumbo-5.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/WeWork_Labs_Dumbo-5.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/WeWork_Labs_Dumbo-5.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">WeWork Labs Dumbo</p></div>
<p>And of course, he plans to open more offices, with the goal of reaching 100 locations by the end of 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;The three of us are sitting in Manhattan right now, one of the wealthiest cities in the world &#8230; but it&#8217;s not about here,&#8221; Adler said. &#8220;It&#8217;s about the people who aren&#8217;t sitting in the big tech hubs or bubbles. <em>That</em> is exciting.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AT&amp;T&#8217;s live TV streaming service, DirecTV Now, is not doing so well. Along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/att-reports-misses-on-revenue-for-q4-2018/">AT&amp;T&#8217;s fourth-quarter earnings</a> released this morning, the company reported a sizable loss of 267,000 DirecTV Now subscribers. This left AT&amp;T with fewer DirecTV Now customers at the end of the year (1.6 million), than <a href="https://about.att.com/story/att_second_quarter_earnings_2018.html">it had in Q2</a> (1.8 million).</p>
<p>The company attributed the decline to the end of promotional-package pricing, which sometimes saw the service priced as <a href="https://thestreamable.com/guides/live-tv-streaming/reviews/directv-now/how-to-get-directv-now-for-10-month">low as $10 per month</a> for an introductory period. It had also offered device <a href="https://thestreamable.com/guides/live-tv-streaming/reviews/directv-now/free-devices">giveaways</a> &#8212; like Roku streaming sticks or Apple TV boxes &#8212; to encourage signups.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T says its &#8220;discounted introductory offers ended,&#8221; which resulted in the dramatic loss.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s masking a larger concern. DirecTV Now subscribers didn&#8217;t see the value in paying full price for streaming live TV via AT&amp;T&#8217;s service, even though its streaming packages <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/02/att-raises-directv-now-pricing-by-5-per-month/">start at $40 per month</a> &#8212; which is a competitive price point among similar live TV services. Hulu with Live TV, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/hulu-drops-the-price-for-its-streaming-service-to-6-per-month-but-raises-prices-for-live-tv/">just raised prices for its core live TV package</a> to $45 per month, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/12/youtube-tv-pricing-goes-up-by-5-month-starting-tomorrow/">YouTube TV raised its price</a> to $40 per month last March.</p>
<p>Even the low-cost skinny bundle from Dish&#8217;s Sling TV <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/sling-tv-revamps-its-service-with-a-price-hike-new-free-tier-a-la-carte-channels/">inched up its base package</a> by $5 per month last summer.</p>
<p>The subscribers who are ditching DirecTV Now aren&#8217;t necessarily doing so because they&#8217;re not interested in streaming TV &#8212; they may just find the DirecTV Now product lacking.</p>
<p>Its cloud DVR feature, for instance, only offers 20 hours of recording space and saves shows for a month. Sling TV and Hulu offer 50 hours of storage. YouTube TV&#8217;s DVR is unlimited. Several services today offer to save shows for far longer than 30 days, as well.</p>
<p>The DirecTV Now interface is fairly basic, compared to rivals, which are today competing on making services <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/09/hulu-redesign-will-drop-the-confusing-home-screen-called-lineup-simplify-navigation/">better personalized to customers.</a> DirecTV Now, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.directvnow.com/blog/personalize-directv-now/">considers</a> marking favorite channels or bookmarking shows to a library a form of personalization.</p>
<p>The company is also putting its eggs in a number of different baskets when it comes to streaming. Instead of just offering one package that customers can customize with add-ons, it offers multiple streaming services. While DirecTV Now does offer <a href="https://www.directvnow.com/">tiered pricing plans</a> that increase the number of channels available, AT&amp;T additionally today operates a second,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/21/att-launches-a-low-cost-live-tv-streaming-service-watchtv/"> low-cost, entertainment-focused service </a>called <a href="https://www.attwatchtv.com/">WatchTV</a>, which is bundled with some AT&amp;T wireless plans and largely meant to reduce wireless subscriber churn.</p>
<p>On top of that, the company&#8217;s WarnerMedia division is rolling out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/10/att-will-launch-another-streaming-service-in-2019-with-hbo-and-other-warnermedia-content/">yet another service</a> later this year, to leverage AT&amp;T&#8217;s newly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/15/att-completes-its-acquisition-of-time-warner/">acquired</a> WarnerMedia properties, like HBO. And HBO has its own over-the-top offering, too, with HBO NOW.</p>
<p>That means AT&amp;T&#8217;s DirecTV Now won&#8217;t only be competing with other live TV services, it will be competing with other AT&amp;T streaming services, too.</p>
<p>Of course, one could argue that it&#8217;s not fair to position a live TV streaming service against one that&#8217;s more movie-focused, as the upcoming direct-to-consumer WarnerMedia offering will be. But at the end of the day, consumers only have so many extra dollars per month to spend on streaming. And they don&#8217;t seem to be dropping Netflix.</p>
<p>Instead, they&#8217;re choosing from among dozens of options to customize their cord-cutter bundles, ranging from true à la carte TV, as with Amazon Channels, to free TV and movies, as with The Roku Channel, to live TV streaming services and subscription videos services, like Hulu. Perhaps AT&amp;T believes if it offers enough variety, at least one of its services will get inserted into that mix.</p>
<p>More concerning for DirecTV Now&#8217;s future is that AT&amp;T believes the answer to concerns is to raise prices and reduce the number of channels. As The Wall St. Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-wants-to-be-big-in-entertainment-first-it-has-a-49-billion-problem-to-fix-11548777413">recently reported,</a> AT&amp;T execs think newcomers like Google&#8217;s YouTube TV are subsidizing an unprofitable service. AT&amp;T CEO <a href="https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/att-randall-stephenson-friends-hbo-netflix-1203079345/">Randall Stephenson said in December</a> that DirecTV Now will not do that &#8212; in fact, it&#8217;s in the process of &#8220;thinning the content out&#8221; to keep the price tag around &#8220;$50 to $60&#8221; &#8212; meaning, at least $10 per month more than it is today.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the wake of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/">TechCrunch&#8217;s investigation yesterday</a>, Apple blocked Facebook&#8217;s Research VPN app before the social network could voluntarily shut it down. The Research app asked users for root network access to all data passing through their phone in exchange for $20 per month. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> tells TechCrunch that yesterday evening it revoked the Enterprise Certificate that allows <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to distribute the Research app without going through the App Store.</p>
<p>TechCrunch had reported that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/">Facebook was breaking Apple&#8217;s policy</a> that the Enterprise system is only for distributing internal corporate apps to employees, not paid external testers. That was actually before Facebook released a statement last night saying that it had shut down the iOS version of the Research program without mentioning that it was forced by Apple to do so.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="B86dSkIEgr"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/">Facebook pays teens to install VPN that spies on them</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/embed/#?secret=B86dSkIEgr" data-secret="B86dSkIEgr" width="800" height="450" title="&#8220;Facebook pays teens to install VPN that spies on them&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s investigation discovered that Facebook has been quietly operated the Research program on iOS and Android since 2016, recently under the name Project Atlas. It recruited 13 to 35 year olds, 5 percent of which were teenagers, with ads on Instagram and Snapchat and paid them a monthly fee plus referral bonuses to install Facebook&#8217;s Research app, the included VPN app that routes traffic to Facebook, and to &#8216;Trust&#8217; the company with root network access to their phone. That lets Facebook pull in a user&#8217;s web browsing activity, what apps are on their phone and how they use them, and even decrypt their encrypted traffic. Facebook went so far as to ask users to screenshot and submit their Amazon order history. Facebook uses all this data to track competitors, assess trends, and plan its product roadmap.</p>
<p>Facebook was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-to-remove-data-security-app-from-apple-store-1534975340">forced to remove</a> its similar Onavo Protect app in August last year after Apple changed its policies to prohibit the VPN app&#8217;s data collection practices. But Facebook never shut down the Research app with the same functionality it was running in parallel. In fact, TechCrunch commissioned security expert Will Strafach to dig into the Facebook Research app, and we found that it featured tons of similar code and references to Onavo Protect. That means Facebook was purposefully disobeying the spirit of Apple&#8217;s 2018 privacy policy change while also abusing the Enterprise Certificate program.</p>
<p>Sources tell us that Apple revoking Facebook&#8217;s Enterprise Certificate has broken all of the company&#8217;s legitimate employee-only apps. Those include pre-launch internal-testing versions of Facebook and Instagram, as well as the employee apps for coordinating office collaboration, commutes, seeing the day&#8217;s lunch schedule, and more. That&#8217;s causing mayhem at Facebook, disrupting their daily work flow and ability to do product development. We predicted yesterday that Apple could take this drastic step to punish Facebook much harder than just removing its Research app. The disruption will translate into a huge loss of productivity for Facebook&#8217;s 33,000 employees.</p>
<p>[Update: Facebook later confirmed to TechCrunch that its internal apps were broken by Apple&#8217;s punishment and that it&#8217;s in talks with Apple to try to resolve the issue and get their employee tools running again.]</p>
<p>For reference, Facebook&#8217;s main iOS app still functions normally. Also, you can&#8217;t get paid for installing Onavo Protect on Android, only for the Facebook Research app. And Facebook isn&#8217;t the only one violating Apple&#8217;s Enterprise Certificate policy, as TechCrunch discovered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/googles-also-peddling-a-data-collector-through-apples-back-door/">Google&#8217;s Screenwise Meter surveillance app breaks the rules too</a>.</p>

<p>This morning, Apple informed us it had banned Facebook&#8217;s Research app yesterday before the social network seemingly pulled it voluntarily. Apple provided us with this strongly worded statement condemning the social network&#8217;s behavior:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;We designed our Enterprise Developer Program solely for the internal distribution of apps within an organization. Facebook has been using their membership to distribute a data-collecting app to consumers, which is a clear breach of their agreement with Apple. Any developer using their enterprise certificates to distribute apps to consumers will have their certificates revoked, which is what we did in this case to protect our users and their data.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>That comes in direct contradiction to Facebook&#8217;s initial response to our investigation. Facebook claimed it was in alignment with Apple&#8217;s Enterprise Certificate policy and that the program was no different than a focus group.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-1775585 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-advertises-Project-Atlas-Research.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="625" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-advertises-Project-Atlas-Research.png 977w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-advertises-Project-Atlas-Research.png?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-advertises-Project-Atlas-Research.png?resize=300,276 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-advertises-Project-Atlas-Research.png?resize=768,706 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-advertises-Project-Atlas-Research.png?resize=680,625 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Facebook-advertises-Project-Atlas-Research.png?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Seven hours later, a Facebook spokesperson said it was pulling its Research program from iOS without mentioning that Apple forced it to do so, and issued this statement disputing the characterization of our story:</p>
<p><i>“Key facts about this market research program are being ignored. Despite early reports, there was nothing ‘secret’ about this; it was literally called the Facebook Research App. It wasn’t ‘spying’ as all of the people who signed up to participate went through a clear on-boarding process asking for their permission and were paid to participate. Finally, less than 5 percent of the people who chose to participate in this market research program were teens. All of them with signed parental consent forms.”</i></p>
<p>We refute those accusations by Facebook. As we wrote yesterday night, Facebook did not publicly promote the Research VPN itself and used intermediaries that often didn’t disclose Facebook’s involvement until users had begun the signup process. While users were given clear instructions and warnings, the program never stresses nor mentions the full extent of the data Facebook can collect through the VPN. A small fraction of the users paid may have been teens, but we stand by the newsworthiness of its choice not to exclude minors from this data collection initiative.</p>
<p>Senator Mark Warner has since called on Facebook CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="mark-zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/facebook-research-app/">to support legislation requiring individual informed consent for market research initiatives</a> like Facebook Research. Meanwhile, Senator Richard Blumenthal issued a fierce statement that <span class="s1">“Wiretapping teens is not research, and it should never be permissible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The situation will surely worsen the relationship between Facebook and Apple after years of mounting animosity between the tech giants. Apple&#8217;s <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/tim-cook" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="tim-cook">Tim Cook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has repeatedly criticized Facebook&#8217;s data collection practices, and Zuckerberg has countered that it offers products for free for everyone rather than making products few can afford like Apple. Flared tensions could see Facebook receive less promotion in the App Store, fewer integrations into iOS, and more jabs from Cook. Meanwhile, the world sees Facebook as having been caught red-handed threatening user privacy and breaking Apple policy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you’re interested in Meizu’s insane smartphone that doesn’t have any port or button, you can now pre-order it on <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meizu-zero-world-s-first-holeless-phone#/">Indiegogo</a> for $1,299. Supply is limited as the company is only selling 100 units for now.</p>
<p>The Meizu Zero looks like any modern phone at first sight. But if you look beyond the display, you’ll notice that there’s absolutely zero port or button.</p>
<p>The volume button has been replaced with a touch-sensitive surface. The fingerprint sensor is integrated in the display. Wireless charging is the only way to charge the device. And if you’re thinking about putting your SIM card in the phone, there’s no SIM slot either — I hope your carrier supports eSIM cards.</p>
<p>There’s no speaker grille either. Meizu is using the screen as a speaker by sending vibrations through the display. It also works as a microphone, apparently.</p>
<p>It’s unclear if this is just a giant joke or an actual product. But it’s an interesting experiment. For $1,299, you get a phone with a 5.99-inch AMOLED display and a Snapdragon 845 system-on-a-chip. The company expects to ship the device in April 2019.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you are a web developer, you know how complex many of the traditional web content management systems have been. One of the big problems has been managing the underlying infrastructure for the system. <a href="https://cosmicjs.com/">Cosmic JS</a>, a member of the Winter 2019 <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> class, wants to simplify that by taking care of the infrastructure part for you, while providing a flexible front end for content creators.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our customers benefit from using Cosmic because they can avoid the pain of building and maintaining their own CMS infrastructure. For a monthly service fee, we provide a seamless infrastructure for them, and it allows them to focus on what really matters, building great products and user experiences,&#8221; <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cosmic-js" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cosmic-js">Cosmic JS <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO and co-founder Tony Spiro told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>As with so many YC companies, this one started with a pain point the founders were feeling in their jobs developing websites in an agency setting in 2014. Spiro was building the websites and CMO and co-founder Carson Gibbons was servicing accounts, and they saw a problem with the infrastructure piece.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that there was a huge bottleneck just installing and maintaining our own backend infrastructure management. So around that time, I began building out Cosmic on the side. I thought it would be great if there was just a web dashboard and an API to deliver content as a service. And so that&#8217;s how it all got started,&#8221; Spiro explained. By removing infrastructure management from the equation, Cosmic was freeing developers to concentrate solely on the customer-facing bits.</p>

<p>Spiro and Gibbons left their jobs to concentrate on Cosmic full time after the release of the initial version in 2016. They aim the product at web development teams with between 5 and 100 members. The product has three main user types: developers, site managers and content producers. So far, it has attracted 250 customers in 100 countries.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s not open source, it does rely on community members to build <a href="https://cosmicjs.com/extensions/">extensions</a> and <a href="https://cosmicjs.com/apps">apps</a>. &#8220;We have hundreds of apps (ready-made websites and applications) and extensions built by our community,&#8221; Spiro said. These tools enable Cosmic to connect to best of breed services and tools like photos, videos or search without having to create them from scratch.</p>

<p>Spiro says that they joined <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/y-combinator" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="y-combinator">Y Combinator <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> at the behest of their advisors and investors and it has been a formative experience. &#8220;We applied and got in, and and now we&#8217;re surrounded by just some of the most impressive and intelligent people in technology.&#8221; Spiro said.</p>
<p>So far Cosmic JS includes the two co-founders with some contractors and freelancers helping out along with the extended development community. The company has received some funding, but the founders weren&#8217;t ready to share the amount just yet.</p>
<p>Their goal is to continue building the paid user base, and increase community participation through outreach and events.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India&#8217;s largest bank has secured an unprotected server that allowed anyone to access financial information on millions of its customers, like bank balances and recent transactions.</p>
<p>The server, hosted in a regional Mumbai-based data center, stored two months of data from SBI Quick, a text message and call-based system used to request basic information about their bank accounts by customers of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/state-bank-of-india#section-overview">the government-owned State Bank of India</a> (SBI), the largest bank in the country and a highly ranked company in the Fortune 500.</p>
<p>But the bank had not protected the server with a password, allowing anyone who knew where to look to access the data on millions of customers&#8217; information.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not known for how long the server was open, but long enough for it to be discovered by a security researcher, who told TechCrunch of the leak, but did not want to be named for the story.</p>
<p>SBI Quick allows SBI&#8217;s banking customers to text the bank, or make a missed call, to retrieve information back by text message about their finances and accounts. It&#8217;s ideal for millions of the banking giant&#8217;s customers who don&#8217;t use smartphones or have limited data service. By using predefined keywords, like &#8220;BAL&#8221; for a customer&#8217;s current balance, the service recognizes the customer&#8217;s registered phone number and will send back the current amount in that customer&#8217;s bank account. The system can also be used to send back the last five transactions, block an ATM card and make inquiries about home or car loans.</p>
<p>It was the back-end text message system that was exposed, TechCrunch can confirm, storing millions of text messages each day.</p>
<div id="attachment_1776483" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="breakout wp-image-1776483 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-30-at-9.07.43-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="507" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-30-at-9.07.43-AM.png 2082w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-30-at-9.07.43-AM.png?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-30-at-9.07.43-AM.png?resize=300,148 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-30-at-9.07.43-AM.png?resize=768,380 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-30-at-9.07.43-AM.png?resize=680,336 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-30-at-9.07.43-AM.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A redacted example of some of the banking and credit information found in the database (Image: TechCrunch)</p></div>
<p>The passwordless database allowed us to see all of the text messages going to customers in real time, including their phone numbers, bank balances and recent transactions. The database also contained the customer&#8217;s partial bank account number. Some would say when a check had been cashed, and many of the bank&#8217;s sent messages included a link to download SBI&#8217;s YONO app for internet banking.</p>
<p>The bank sent out close to three million text messages on Monday alone.</p>
<p>The database also had daily archives of millions of text messages each, going back to December, allowing anyone with access a detailed view into millions of customers&#8217; finances.</p>
<p>We verified the data by asking India-based security researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/iasni">Karan Saini</a> to send a text message to the system. Within seconds, we found his phone number in the database, including the text message he received back.</p>
<p>&#8220;The data available could potentially be used to profile and target individuals that are known to have high account balances,&#8221; said Saini in a message to TechCrunch. Saini previously <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/another-data-leak-hits-india-aadhaar-biometric-database/">found a data leak</a> in India&#8217;s Aadhaar, the country&#8217;s national identity database, and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/uber-security-flaw-two-factor-login-bypass/">a two-factor bypass bug</a> in Uber&#8217;s ridesharing app.</p>
<p>Saini said that knowing a phone number &#8220;could be used to aid social engineering attacks — which is one of the most common attack vectors in the country with regard to financial fraud,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>SBI <a href="https://www.sbichicago.com/about-us/about-sbi">claims more than</a> 500 million customers across the glob,e with 740 million accounts.</p>
<p>Just days earlier, SBI accused Aadhaar&#8217;s authority, UIDAI, of mishandling citizen data that allowed fake Aadhaar identity cards to be created, despite <a href="https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uidai-says-tribune-story-misreporting--read-how-that-is-wrong/523478.html">numerous security lapses</a> and misuse of the system. UIDAI denied the report, saying there was &#8220;no security breach&#8221; of its system. (UIDAI often uses <a href="https://twitter.com/UIDAI/status/1023543590033608705">the term &#8220;fake news&#8221;</a> to describe coverage it doesn&#8217;t like.)</p>
<p>TechCrunch reached out to SBI and India&#8217;s National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre, which receives vulnerability reports for the banking sector. The database was secured overnight.</p>
<p>Despite several emails, SBI did not comment prior to publication.</p>
