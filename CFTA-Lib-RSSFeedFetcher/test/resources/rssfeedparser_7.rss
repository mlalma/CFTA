			<p><b style="color: #2d2d2d; font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; text-transform: inherit;">Basic Attention Token Digital Asset Report: Introduction</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BAT is a blockchain-based digital advertising platform that improves the efficiency of digital advertising, while blocking malvertisements (ads that install malware) and trackers. This platform improves communications between advertisers, publishers, and users. Advertisers pay publishers for services and users for attention with BAT tokens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BAT is an open source, transparent, decentralized and efficient project that was first to develop a digital advertising platform in the blockchain industry. In addition, the team behind the BAT project is very strong. It has established a wide network of users, advertisers, and publishers, and is working on expanding partnerships. This project has a good token economy and an active ecosystem that makes BAT competitive in the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, there is one drawback that may become a serious obstacle to the further development of the ecosystem. BAT is currently dependent on the throughput capacity of Ethereum. This means that with an increase in the number of transactions in the BAT network, the load on the Ethereum network will increase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, when the peak is reached, the Ethereum network will not be able to process the huge number of transactions, therefore, the BAT network will begin to slow down too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another drawback of the BAT project is a well-expressed centralization of power, which reduces its attractiveness. Together, these two factors can lead to a slower expansion of the project in the long-term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, BAT has good chances to remain a key player in the digital advertising industry in the short-term. However, it is necessary to resolve the mentioned problems, otherwise, its rivals will be able to push it out of the market in the long-term. </span></p>

<h3><strong>Part One: The Business Case</strong></h3>
<h4><b>Basic Attention Token Market Opportunities</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BAT team believes that digital advertising does not work effectively and there are a </span><a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">number of reasons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, over 600 million phones and desktops run ad-blocking because the amount of advertising on the network is huge. Moreover, the quality of advertising can be questionable and even harmful to devices. In addition, advertising slows down the speed of the devices and reduces the battery life of phones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only are the users unhappy, but publishers and advertisers are unsatisfied as well: publishers lose profit, while advertisers have low efficiency of targeted advertising.</span><a href="https://litecoin.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main participants in the digital advertising market are Google and Facebook, which cover about</span><a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Chart/Net-Digital-Ad-Revenue-Share-Worldwide-by-Company-2016-2019-of-total-billions/205364"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">40%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, the size of the digital advertising market amounted to</span><a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/216/100/digital-advertising/worldwide#market-revenue"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$266 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it is expected to reach $518 billion in 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital advertising consists of several types: banner, video, search, social media advertising and classifieds.</span><a href="https://litecoin.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-28516 size-full" src="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Net-Digital-Ad-Revenue-Share-Worldwide-by-Company.png" alt="Net Digital Ad Revenue Share Worldwide by Company" width="685" height="464" srcset="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Net-Digital-Ad-Revenue-Share-Worldwide-by-Company.png 685w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Net-Digital-Ad-Revenue-Share-Worldwide-by-Company-300x203.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the presence of these two giants, BAT can find a niche because it addresses the pain points discussed above.</span></p>
<hr />
<h4><b>Competition in the Blockchain Space</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-28518 size-full" src="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BAT-competition-in-the-blockchain-space.png" alt="BAT competition in the blockchain space" width="660" height="940" srcset="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BAT-competition-in-the-blockchain-space.png 660w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BAT-competition-in-the-blockchain-space-211x300.png 211w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AdEx is focused on digital video advertising, while BAT intends to cover all kinds of digital advertising. In addition, BAT has many advantages over AdEx: users are more incentivized to participate in the ecosystem development, large network of partners, users, publishers and advertisers, and a better token economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another representative of companies in the digital advertising industry is</span><a href="https://metax.io/adtoken/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">adChain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But it is considered as</span><a href="https://metax.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003190994-How-is-adChain-different-from-BAT-"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a complement to BAT</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The main goal of adChain is to create a list of non-fraudulent websites where advertisers can easily place their ads. In order to enter this list, the community must vote for the fact that the publisher is not a fraud. adChain solves a specific problem related to the transparency of the work of publishers, and this, in turn, can improve the work of BAT. Therefore, these two projects should not be considered as competitors, but as complementary to each other. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A direct competitor to BAT is DATA, a blockchain based digital data authentication protocol powered by AI &amp; P2P mobile storage infrastructure. Despite the fact that DATA can make good competition, BAT is a more promising project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DATA is built on Tendermint,and this project is more advanced in terms of technology. However, the BAT ecosystem is more active and it serves more than</span><a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/2018-highlights/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">5.5 million active users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> monthly and 28,000 verified publishers. Also,  BAT is able to cover a larger part of the market than DATA because the Brave browser can be used by both mobile and PC users. The BAT project is better known in the blockchain space, has a wide base of users and partners, has a good token economy, and it is more attractive in the long-term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, there are social media and blogging platform projects, for example, Steem.  Many dApps have been developed on this blockchain.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steemit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enables publishers to publish their content and receive tokens if the community votes for the content.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://d.tube/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DTube</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rewards video creators for their content (a replacement for YouTube).</span></p>
<p><a href="https://dlive.tv/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dlive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rewards live streamers (a replacement for Twitch). There are also other dApps developed on the Steem blockchain, which can compete with BAT.</span></p>
<div class="bs-shortcode-alert alert alert-info"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Steem has better technology and has no transaction fees, its dApps can look more attractive than the BAT platform. However, BAT and Steem can cooperate, which could stimulate development.</span></div>
<hr />
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">NVT Comparison</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since <a href="https://coinmetrics.io/charts/#assets=eth,trx,bat_left=NVT_zoom=1438388375510.204,1548201600000">NVT values</a> are not available to competitors of BAT, a comparison was made with Ethereum and Tron. Most of the rivals are built on the Ethereum network, therefore, this blockchain was chosen. Tron, in turn, is the most similar platform of dApps to Steem. As seen in the figure below BAT transactions are overvalued a little. This is because the community expects the successful launch of the BAT platform.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-28519 size-full" src="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NVT-Comparison-1.png" alt="BAT NVT Comparison" width="762" height="564" srcset="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NVT-Comparison-1.png 762w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NVT-Comparison-1-300x222.png 300w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NVT-Comparison-1-86x64.png 86w" sizes="(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main competitors in the traditional sphere – Google, Facebook, and Baidu. Google is a search engine company, Facebook &#8211; an online social media and social networking services company, which make most of its revenue from digital advertising. Baidu &#8211; is a Chinese search engine company also specializing in AI and digital distribution services. BAT intends to compete with these giants.</span></p>
<hr />
<h4><b>Competition in the Traditional Space</b></h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-28521 size-full" src="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BAT-competition-in-the-traditional-space.png" alt="BAT competition in the traditional space" width="660" height="430" srcset="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BAT-competition-in-the-traditional-space.png 660w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BAT-competition-in-the-traditional-space-300x195.png 300w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BAT-competition-in-the-traditional-space-210x136.png 210w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BAT project poses a threat to Google and Facebook because the Brave browser blocks ads and trackers. This reduces the number of ad views in Google and Facebook and reduces their profits. In addition, the Brave browser runs </span><a href="https://brave.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3-7 times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> faster compared to Chrome on Android, more on iOS, and ~2 times on laptop. Chrome utilizes only a cosmetic advertising filter, which is not comparable with the BAT technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BAT can also take market share from Baidu, which owns the mobile advertising platform called “</span><a href="http://ad.duapps.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DU Ad Platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”. Firstly, Brave users can simply block ads, which will reduce the efficiency of the Baidu platform. Secondly, users of the BAT ecosystem are more interested in viewing ads than the clients of the Baidu platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the fact that Google and Facebook have huge financial, technological and human resources, BAT has the opportunity to cover part of the digital advertising market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BAT project is one of the first to develop a digital advertising exchange platform based on blockchain technology. There are few competitors in this sphere, which can create serious threats to BAT, but, nevertheless, it is necessary to work on improving the technology, since BAT&#8217;s efficiency depends on the Ethereum network.</span></p>
<hr />
<h4><strong>Ecosystem Development</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BAT platform is built on the Ethereum blockchain and utilizes the PoW consensus algorithm. As a result, its functionality depends on the work of Ethereum and has a limited throughput capacity, which may adversely affect the development of the ecosystem in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, the project ecosystem is developing very rapidly compared to its rivals. The main company involved in the development of BAT is Brave Software Inc. The team has significantly increased the client base and expanded the partnerships, which distinguishes it among other projects. A centralization of power is observed in the project ecosystem, but most likely, the platform will become more decentralized over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main two components of the BAT platform are the Brave browser and the BAT token. The BAT token is built on the Ethereum network; therefore, the BAT project has no own nodes that support the BAT network. The graph below shows that most of the Ethereum nodes on which it relies are located in the USA, China, and Canada, which are about </span><a href="https://www.ethernodes.org/network/1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">77%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of all nodes in the network.</span></p>
<hr />
<h5>Node Distribution (Ethereum)</h5>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28522" src="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Nodes-Distribution.jpg" alt="Ethereum node distribution" width="1179" height="470" srcset="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Nodes-Distribution.jpg 1179w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Nodes-Distribution-300x120.jpg 300w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Nodes-Distribution-768x306.jpg 768w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Nodes-Distribution-1024x408.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1179px) 100vw, 1179px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following graph shows the hash rate distribution among mining pools. The first pool, Ethermine, has 25.7% of the computing power of the entire network, Sparkpool – 22.5%, Nanopool – 13.5%, f2pool2 – 10.3%, miningpoolhub1 – 6.3%. In total, this is </span><a href="https://www.etherchain.org/charts/topMiners"><span style="font-weight: 400;">78.3%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the total computing power of the network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This shows that the Ethereum network is subject to centralization of computing power, therefore, it may be vulnerable to attacks, although <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/ethereum-51-percent-attack-myth/">research by ConsenSys</a> suggests otherwise. If Ethereum IS vulnerable, the functioning of the BAT token might also be disrupted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28530" src="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Top-Ethereum-Miners.png" alt="Top Ethereum Miners" width="650" height="383" srcset="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Top-Ethereum-Miners.png 650w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Top-Ethereum-Miners-300x177.png 300w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Top-Ethereum-Miners-357x210.png 357w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the centralization of power is manifested within the BAT ecosystem itself. To verify this fact, it is enough to look at the distribution of tokens among top wallets.  It can be seen that there is a weakly-expressed centralization of power, although to a lesser extent than most of its competitors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28532" src="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Basic-Attention-Token-rich-wallets.png" alt="Basic Attention Token rich wallets" width="660" height="520" srcset="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Basic-Attention-Token-rich-wallets.png 660w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Basic-Attention-Token-rich-wallets-300x236.png 300w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Basic-Attention-Token-rich-wallets-279x220.png 279w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we analyze the wallets in detail, we can see that </span><a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x0d8775f648430679a709e98d2b0cb6250d2887ef?a=0x7c31560552170ce96c4a7b018e93cddc19dc61b6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the first wallet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the User Growth Pool Reserve. This wallet has a purpose for the project and it is not the property of one holder. The next two wallets belong to two major exchanges, therefore, it is normal that they have such large amounts of tokens. It&#8217;s even good that there are such volumes on the exchanges, which indicates the interest in this token. Thus, it turns out that the seven first wallets control only </span><a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x0d8775f648430679a709e98d2b0cb6250d2887ef#balances"><span style="font-weight: 400;">13.7%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and this is much less than the overall top 10 figure of 49.6%,  and indicates a somewhat weaker manifestation of centralization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we analyze the </span><a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x0d8775f648430679a709e98d2b0cb6250d2887ef#balances"><span style="font-weight: 400;">top-100 wallets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we discover that in addition to 18% of tokens reserved in the pool for users, another 0.55% are locked up for the team. Furthermore, 6 exchanges control about 20.8% of all tokens, and only 40.3% of tokens remain, which are controlled by 90 wallets. This shows that there is the centralization of power to some extent, but it is not as significant as at first glance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we compare BAT with its competitors, we can see the following token distribution by top-10 wallets:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x4470bb87d77b963a013db939be332f927f2b992e#balances"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AdEx</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – 75% (31% &#8211; exchanges; 44% &#8211; holders)</span></p>
<p><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/adtoken/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AdToken</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – 90% (38% &#8211; exchanges; 52% &#8211; holders)</span></p>
<p><a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x69b148395ce0015c13e36bffbad63f49ef874e03#balances"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DATA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – 82% (50% &#8211; exchanges; 30% &#8211; locked for the team, 2% &#8211; holders)</span></p>
<p><a href="https://steemdb.com/accounts/steem"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – 22% (21% &#8211; exchanges).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The centralization of power in the BAT ecosystem is comparatively lower than that of its competitors, except for Steem. Most likely, with the growth of the community and the number of active users, the User Growth Pool Reserve will be fully distributed among users. That is, that 18% of tokens will be owned by a large number of users. Consequently, the top-10 wallets will contain 18% fewer tokens. This, in turn, will lead to a decrease in the centralization of power in the BAT ecosystem.</span></p>
<div class="bs-shortcode-alert alert alert-warning"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ecosystem development mainly depends on the activity of the Brave Software company. This is the only participant in the BAT ecosystem that makes management decisions. That is also indicative of centralization. </span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financing of their activities is carried out at the expense of tokens collected during the Token Sale (</span><a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/bat-sale-finishes-quickly/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">156,250 ETH</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or ~$35 million).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the Brave browser will charge </span><a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/brave-previews-opt-in-ads-in-desktop-browser-developer-channel/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the advertiser’s payment, which pays publishers (70% of the total) for placing ads and users (15% of the total) for viewing ads. Thus, the team will have a permanent source of funding for the development of the BAT ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we open the </span><a href="https://github.com/brave"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GitHub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the BAT project, we can see that it&#8217;s not only the BAT team working on the project. There are external developers who help to develop the technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main participants in the ecosystem are advertisers, publishers, and users. This digital advertising platform allows advertisers to increase the efficiency of an advertising campaign, publishers – to increase profits, users – to receive rewards for viewing ads and then utilize tokens in various ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team is working hard on expanding the user base, as can be seen from the graph below. The number of active users increased from </span><a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/update-brave-browser-and-bat-achievements-in-2017-and-goals-for-2018/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/2018-highlights/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5.5 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during 2018, meanwhile, the number of verified publishers increased 11.2 times from </span><a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/update-brave-browser-and-bat-achievements-in-2017-and-goals-for-2018/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2,500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/2018-highlights/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">28,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The team is successfully working on the development of the BAT ecosystem.</span></p>

<h4><strong>Partnerships</strong></h4>
<h4><b><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28535" src="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BAT-partnerships.png" alt="BAT partnerships" width="660" height="495" srcset="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BAT-partnerships.png 660w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BAT-partnerships-300x225.png 300w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BAT-partnerships-86x64.png 86w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These companies help to increase the number of active users, extend the functionality of the BAT platform, allow users to instantly </span><a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/bat-now-supported-on-the-uphold-platform/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exchange fiat money for BAT tokens</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and more. This allows BAT to maintain its competitiveness and to cover a larger share of the digital advertising market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of the rapid growth of the BAT ecosystem, it has become significantly dominant over its competitors in terms of community size and network activity, as shown in the table below.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28537" src="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Basic-Attention-Token-community-involvement.png" alt="Basic Attention Token community involvement" width="660" height="300" srcset="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Basic-Attention-Token-community-involvement.png 660w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Basic-Attention-Token-community-involvement-300x136.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BAT ecosystem is much more active compared to its competitors. For example, the BAT project has stronger support from the community, while its rivals have a low amount of followers in the social networks. As a result, the number of active addresses in the BAT network is significantly higher than these values for AdEx, AdToken, and DATA (the data is not available for Steem).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, more transactions per day are  carried out on the Steem blockchain. Steem has a more advanced technology that can process more and faster transactions. Since BAT is built on the Ethereum network, it is difficult to scale to such volumes. The entire network of Ethereum serves </span><a href="https://blocktivity.info/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">554,180</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transactions per day at the moment. This highlights the drawback of BAT when compared to Steem, but if we talk about its direct competitors such as AdEx, AdToken, DATA, then these projects have almost no active users, therefore, almost no transactions are carried out on their networks. </span></p>
<div class="bs-shortcode-alert alert alert-success"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, the BAT ecosystem is growing fast, has active users and wide community. The BAT project has more chances to be adopted worldwide as a digital advertising platform than its competitors do.</span></div>
<hr />
<h4><b>Basic Attention Token Economics </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BAT is an ERC20 token built on top of Ethereum. The token is used as a unit of exchange in a decentralized, open source and efficient blockchain-based digital advertising platform.</span></p>
<p><b>Reward</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – as soon as the BAT platform is fully developed, publishers will start receiving</span><a href="https://brave.com/brave-previews-opt-in-ads-in-desktop-browser-developer-channel/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">70%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the ad revenue, users – 15% for the attention attached to viewing ads, and Brave will receive the remaining 15%.</span></p>
<p><b>Fees </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; the transaction fees encourage miners of the Ethereum network to mine and confirm the relevant transactions. The size of the transaction fees depends on the Ethereum network and fees are paid in </span><a href="https://ethgasstation.info/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GAS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The same situation is also observed among competitors except for Steem and DATA: Steem has no transaction fees; the gas fee in DATA ecosystem will be similar to Ethereum ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the transaction fees in the BAT ecosystem depend on  the workload of the Ethereum network. This leads to the fact that BAT transaction costs can be more expensive than the actual value of the transaction itself.</span></p>
<p><b>Speculation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; BAT is traded on many of the popular </span><a href="https://coincodex.com/crypto/basic-attention-token/exchanges/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto-exchanges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Payment &#8211; </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">to stimulate the development of the BAT ecosystem, the team intends to provide many applications of the token. In this case, the user will have more choices how to use tokens. First, BAT will encourage publishers for placing ads and users for the attention, and then, the team will expand the range of the token use. That is, users will be able not only receive rewards for attention and donate tokens to publishers, but also receive other services:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Premium content subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; High-quality content (video or audio on an entertainment channel, news) may also be offered to users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Comments may be ranked using BAT tokens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; BAT may be used within the Brave ecosystem to purchase digital goods such as high-resolution photos, data services, or publisher applications which are only needed on a one-time basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, BAT services will go beyond the boundaries of digital advertising platform and, as a result, will attract more users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BAT team held the Token Sale on May 31, 2017 and collected </span><a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/bat-sale-finishes-quickly/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">156,250 ETH</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (~$35 million) in less than 30 seconds. The BAT project also received another $7 million from various venture capital firms (Digital Currency Group, Pantera Capital, etc.). The token distribution looks as follows:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Tokens for Token Sale: 1 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; User Growth Pool: 300 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; BAT Development Pool: 200 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BAT project allocated 20% of all its tokens to encourage and stimulate the development of the platform, which shows the interest of the team in the successful launch of the project. Overall, the User Growth Pool is used to incentivize users to utilize the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When installing the Brave browser, the user receives 35 BAT, which can be used only within the BAT ecosystem. If these tokens are not used within 6 months, they will be returned back to the User Growth Pool and may be accrued by another new user. Existing users can also receive tokens from this pool if they update the application or verify phone number. After using all the tokens from the pool, the team does not intend to issue new ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team intends to use </span><a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/announcing-the-targeted-amount-of-the-upcoming-sale/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">all other financial resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for development, marketing, operations and other expenses:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; </span><b>BAT Development</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – 58% &#8211; to develop the existing Brave browser technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; </span><b>Contingency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – 7% &#8211; for unforeseen costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; </span><b>Marketing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – 12% &#8211; to expand awareness and adoption of the Brave browser and the BAT solution among the targeted audience, to grow the BAT community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; </span><b>Contractors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – 13% &#8211; to third-party providers for marketing, PR, engineering and other purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; </span><b>Administration</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – 10% &#8211; to cover legal, security, accounting, and other administrative expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also necessary to note that BAT issued a fixed number of tokens, that is, the project has a deflationary model of the economy. This suggests that with the expansion of the project community, the value of its token will appreciate. However, the deflationary models were also implemented by competitors so from this point of view BAT has no competitive advantage over its rivals.</span></p>

<h4><strong>Supply Comparison</strong></h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28538" src="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BAT-Supply-Comparison.png" alt="BAT Supply Comparison" width="645" height="276" srcset="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BAT-Supply-Comparison.png 645w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BAT-Supply-Comparison-300x128.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="bs-shortcode-alert alert alert-success"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the one hand, the BAT project has a token economics model similar to that of its rivals. That is, the BAT token is ERC-20 and, therefore, depends on the Ethereum network as well as some of its competitors. Moreover, its deflationary model is not a distinctive characteristic. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, the token economics is built in a way which stimulates the participation of all users in the ecosystem &#8211; critical to adoption within a two-sided marketplace.</span></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brendan Eich and Brian Bondy founded Brave Software Inc. on May 28, 2015. And on January 20, 2016, the company launched the first version of the Brave browser. At first, users used BTC inside the Brave browser, but after the ICO was conducted, the team developed its own token on Ethereum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sizeable team of more than </span><a href="https://brave.com/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">70 people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is working on the BAT project. In particular, the team includes experienced software, QA, machine learning, security engineers, and others. In addition to a strong technical staff, the team has employees who work on marketing, product development, and communication with the community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, in order to increase their accountability and transparency, the team always publishes all its updates and achievements on </span><a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/blog/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blogs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://github.com/brave"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GitHub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is worth mentioning that </span><a href="https://brave.com/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two professors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> work with the BAT team: Ben Livshits and Hamed Haddadi.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BAT team does not include legal staff, however, they operate under the legal counsel of international law firm Perkins-Coie. This partnership indicates that the team takes legal issues seriously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This team brought together very experienced and intelligent employees who have the relevant experience to further scale the project. Their experience corresponds to their ambitions and they openly talk about their plans and achievements. The composition of the team is built in such a way that allows working effectively on the technical, marketing, financial and other components of the project. In addition, the team currently intends </span><a href="https://brave.com/jobs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to expand its team</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> even more.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Part Two: The Technology Case</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Underlying Technology</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BAT is a decentralized ad network that operates on the Ethereum network. This project is unique in the blockchain space in terms of technology because this is the only project that built a decentralized digital advertising platform inside its own browser.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BAT has the same scalability prospects of the platform as its competitors, with the exception of the DATA project, which is technologically stronger. Nevertheless, the BAT team actively works on the further development of its product, as seen from the GitHub activity, which shows the team’s confidence in the future of their platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technology of the BAT project is represented by three main components: Brave browser, BAT token, and Basic Attention Metrics (BAM).</span></p>
<p><a href="https://brave.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brave</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – is a fast, open source, privacy-focused browser that blocks ads and trackers. This allows increasing the speed of the browser. As a result, Brave loads web pages </span><a href="https://brave.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2-8 times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> faster than Chrome/Safari on the phone and twice as fast as Chrome on the desktop. This makes the Brave browser one of the fastest among its competitors. It also contains a ledger system that anonymously measures the attention of users in order to properly reward publishers.</span></p>
<hr />
<h4><strong>Blocked Ads and Speed Comparison</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28539" src="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Blocked-Ads-and-Speed-Comparison.jpg" alt="Blocked Ads and Speed Comparison" width="845" height="482" srcset="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Blocked-Ads-and-Speed-Comparison.jpg 845w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Blocked-Ads-and-Speed-Comparison-300x171.jpg 300w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Blocked-Ads-and-Speed-Comparison-768x438.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The token is based on Ethereum smart contracts that enable users to make micropayments using BAT within the Brave Ledger. Its operation is based on the interaction of three participants of the ecosystem: advertiser, user, and publisher. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Value Flow of the Basic Attention Token represented below shows the conceptual flow of the BAT token across all platform participants.</span></p>
<hr />
<h4><b>Value Flow of BAT</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28540" src="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Value-Flow-of-BAT.png" alt="Value Flow of BAT" width="546" height="350" srcset="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Value-Flow-of-BAT.png 546w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Value-Flow-of-BAT-300x192.png 300w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Value-Flow-of-BAT-210x136.png 210w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, the advertiser sends ads and tokens in a locked state (Xa) to users. If the users view the ads, then the payment flow unlocks. The users are rewarded for viewing the ads with BAT (Xu) and they can donate a part of their tokens to publishers (Xu). Brave also receives a share of tokens and a remainder is sent to the publisher (Xp). In addition, users can buy extra services like premium content (Xs).</span></p>
<div class="bs-shortcode-alert alert alert-success"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The integration of Brave browser and Basic Attention Token makes their technology unique in the digital advertising market.</span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The browser contains a special page where a user can view the balance and a list of publishers to which the user is willing to donate tokens. The UI is very simple and convenient at the moment and it is most likely that in the future the user profile will be more functional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it is possible to monitor user behavior on web pages, the BAT team decided to build a model that would reward users based on their attention. That is, the reward amount depends on the time during which the user reviews an advertisement and on the number of pixels that are in the user’s view in proportion to relevant content. Anonymous cost-per-action models will be improved as the system develops. It is also worth to mention that all information about users stays on their devices.</span></p>
<hr />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To accurately measure the user attention several metrics have been developed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of these metrics is 5 full views of advertising content in the active window for at least 5 seconds. Another metric is “</span><a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/BasicAttentionTokenWhitePaper-4.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concave Score</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”: “… a score which rewards a publisher for a thresholded and bounded function of the amount of time spent with the open and active page”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The graphical representation of this metric is shown below, where it can be seen that the relationship between the metric score and the time has the characteristic of diminishing return to scale. That is, for the first few seconds of viewing the content, the user gets one point, for 30 sec – 2 points, for 60 sec – 3 points, and for 12 minutes – 7 points.</span></p>

<h4><strong>Basic Attention Token Metric Score Over Time</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28542" src="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Basic-Attention-Metric-Score-Over-Time.png" alt="Basic Attention Metric Score Over Time" width="457" height="370" srcset="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Basic-Attention-Metric-Score-Over-Time.png 457w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Basic-Attention-Metric-Score-Over-Time-300x243.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BAT team intends to build a platform where users will be rewarded for their attention (which will be implemented </span><a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/brave-previews-opt-in-ads-in-desktop-browser-developer-channel/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">during 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), while users on the platforms of its rivals may be rewarded for clicks or depending on their reputation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BAM system looks better than just rewards for clicks. However, it is hard to surmise  whether the BAT model is better than a model built on reputation or not. This will be seen after the full launch of the platform. There exists a risk that users will create many wallets and view ads only with the intention to earn more tokens. This makes the BAT model a little bit vulnerable in comparison to the reputation-based model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To protect user privacy the Brave ledger system uses the ANONIZE algorithm. This enables the Brave browser to collect user data anonymously and allows Brave users to make anonymous transactions. This algorithm utilizes zero-knowledge proof that proves a mathematical statement is true without knowing anything else about it. Let’s consider how the algorithm is implemented in surveys. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; 1st step: a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">User</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> registers and it is assigned a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Master User Token</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All information stays only on its device.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; 2nd step: the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Survey</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is assigned with a signature key pair: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Survey Identifier</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public Key with User ID</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who is authorized to take the survey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; 3rd step: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">User ID</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> generates a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Single-token</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Survey Identifier</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public Key</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to submit a response &#8211; this represents a non-interactive zero-knowledge problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This ensures that only an authorized user can complete the survey once, all while staying anonymous.</span></p>

<h4><strong>Simplified ANONIZE Algorithm</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28543" src="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Simplified-Anonize-Algorithm.png" alt="Simplified Anonize Algorithm" width="1664" height="772" srcset="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Simplified-Anonize-Algorithm.png 1664w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Simplified-Anonize-Algorithm-300x139.png 300w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Simplified-Anonize-Algorithm-768x356.png 768w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Simplified-Anonize-Algorithm-1024x475.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1664px) 100vw, 1664px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of technology that makes transactions anonymous in the BAT ecosystem distinguishes it from its competitors, giving BAT an advantage &#8211; and it is an attractive feature for users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An important characteristic of any project is its scalability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BAT, as well as AdEx and AdToken, use the PoW consensus protocol and the projects are built on the Ethereum network. Therefore, they can process the same number of transactions per second.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Graphene technology of Steem allows it to process about 10,000 tps and confirm transactions almost instantly compared to BAT. Another direct competitors, DATA, is built on the Tendermint network and utilizes the BFT consensus algorithm, which allows processing about 200 tps confirming transactions in a few seconds.</span></p>
<div class="bs-shortcode-alert alert alert-warning"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of scalability, BAT is inferior to some of its competitors, which can adversely affect the long-term adoption of the project. At the moment, BAT serves about </span><a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/2018-highlights/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5.5 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> active users monthly, but with further growth of the client base, there may be problems with scalability.</span></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team is working on the product development, as seen from the activity on the GitHub. The team has two pages on GitHub: </span><a href="https://github.com/brave"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the first one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contains 137 repositories, and </span><a href="https://github.com/brave-intl"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the second one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – 45. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, its </span><a href="https://www.cryptomiso.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GitHub activity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is average compared to other blockchain projects.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28545" src="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GitHub-Activity-1.png" alt="Basic Attention token GitHub Activity" width="735" height="384" srcset="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GitHub-Activity-1.png 735w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GitHub-Activity-1-300x157.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px" /></p>
<hr />
<h4><strong>Roadmap</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BAT roadmap is very detailed and transparent. The team constantly works on updating it, regularly informs the community about existing updates and works on the development of its product as can be seen from the activity on </span><a href="https://github.com/brave"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GitHub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/announcing-a-new-blockchain-based-digital-advertising-platform/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first roadmap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was published on March 23, 2017, which indicated the initial path of development of the project in general.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><b>Pre-1.0 BAT:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Brave already has an anonymized ledger system for making donations and payments to publishers based on user attention. The secure vault using the ANONIZE algorithm to ensure customer privacy is an important piece of the BAT ecosystem which is already in place and deployed in Brave. Brave is already measuring user attention at the browser and distributing donations to the publishers using this system.</span></p>
<p><b>1.0 BAT:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> BAT wallet integrated with the Brave browser. Verification and transactions to be handled by Brave’s internal</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ledger system to protect individual user anonymity from advertisers, publishers and third parties. Ad inventory will be valued, and transactions will be calculated from reported Basic Attention Metric (BAM) data.</span></p>
<p><b>Beyond 1.0 BAT:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Make the transfer and verification process entirely distributed on Ethereum using a state channel scheme with zero knowledge proof protocol for ensuring user privacy. Add alternate BAM metrics based on advertiser feedback. This will allow for full user privacy as well as a decentralized audit trail for advertisers, users and publishers to ensure they received correct payments for the advertising delivered through the BAT network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first part of this roadmap points to three main components: payment mechanisms, ANONIZE algorithm, and measurement metrics of user attention. These components</span><a href="https://www.ccn.com/brave-browser-launches-bitcoin-micropayments-for-rewarding-user-preferred-websites/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">have already been implemented</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> long before the first roadmap was written.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then after conducting token sale on May 31, 2017, the team published an updated roadmap that contained the second and the third parts (“1.0 BAT” and “Beyond 1.0 BAT”) of the first roadmap. </span><a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/bat-roadmap-1-0/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second roadmap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was published on June 17, 2017 and was very detailed one. The team worked hard to complete all of the tasks, which show the BAT project in a positive light.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><b>BAT Mercury (summer 2017)</b></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BAT Mercury components were launched on </span><a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/bat-mercury-launch/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">October 12, 2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in version 0.19 of the Brave browser. The team completed this part of the roadmap one month late because they wanted to ensure the high standards their users deserve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BAT team also published the information about BAT achievements in 2017 and goals for 2018 in their blog on January 12, 2018, which indicated that the most of BAT Gemini goals were achieved as well. The next major update was published on April 27, 2018: Brave Partners with YouTube Stars Bart Baker and Philip DeFranco, which testifies to the rapid growth of the user base, publishers and partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest roadmap was published on </span><a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/roadmap"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GitHub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which covers all the important milestones of the project from December 2017 to the current moment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the team posted </span><a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/brave-previews-opt-in-ads-in-desktop-browser-developer-channel/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brave Ads Roadmap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to which </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">user ads </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">publisher-integrated ads</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be implemented in 2019. That is, users, publishers, and the Brave browser will receive their share of the advertiser’s payment. The implementation of this feature can be the main catalyst for the subsequent development of the project.</span></p>
<div class="bs-shortcode-alert alert alert-success"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the BAT team does everything to show its transparency and provides an opportunity for the participants of the BAT ecosystem to track the BAT activity, which has a positive effect on their adoption in the future. </span></div>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Part Three: The Investment Case</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>BAT Token Performance</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BAT token is in the top-34 coins by market capitalization and it is in the top-44 coins by trading volume (24H).</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cryptocurrencychart.com/top/-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price dynamics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the BAT token are represented in the graph below, where it can be seen that after ICO was conducted in May 2017, the price of the token reached its first maximum as early as June 4, 2017 (~$0.344).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, there is price fluctuation until December 2017, after which the price rises sharply under the influence of the entire market and reaches its ATH in January 2018 (~$0.972).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, throughout 2018, the price of the BAT token reached three more peaks, two of which were in May and June under the influence of the market, and the last peak occurred in November due to the fact that </span><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/basic-attention-token-bat-is-launching-on-coinbase-pro-3b61a23e9306"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coinbase announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the listing of BAT token.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general the prices fall under the influence of the entire market, but the BAT price falls more slowly than its competitors. Since the January ATH, the price of BAT has dropped by 87%, while the prices of tokens of all its rivals have fallen by more than 96%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the price change of the BAT token is explained by the dynamics of the entire market. However, there are also fundamental reasons for the rise and fall in price, which was observed, for instance, in November of 2018.</span></p>
<hr />
<h4><strong>Price Comparison</strong></h4>

<p><a href="https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/bat/analysis/BTC"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main currencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pairs with which BAT is traded are BTC (65.6%), USDC (12.6%), KRW (12.4%), ETH (6.81%), and BNB (1.60%).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This may indicate that the channel for buying BAT directly for fiat is still weak. Users have to buy BTC or ETH first, and then change it to BAT. The pair of BAT/BNB is also popular because most of the trading is carried out on the Binance exchange (57.2% of all trading volume), which encourages BAT/BNB trading.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair of BAT/KRW is traded on the Upbit exchange (25.9% of all trading volume). The BAT token is traded as well on the Bittrex exchange (14.3%).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The presence of BAT tokens on such three crypto-exchanges indicates its high liquidity</span></p>

			<h4><strong>Introduction To The Framework</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Digital Asset Report and Evaluation (DARE) is a standardized, dynamic approach to evaluating blockchain-based projects and identifying value in the associated crypto-assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report is the result of an exhaustive research and analysis process based on seven fundamental factors. Based on a weighted grading of these seven project fundamentals, a verdict and letter grade conclude each report, which is followed up with periodic updates, released over a quarterly basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The analysis, verdict and accompanying grade reflect our opinion on the long-term value prospects of a given token based on the current state of project development and indicators of future commercial viability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state of product development and indicators of commercial viability derive from an analysis of seven principle project fundamentals &#8211; market opportunity, ecosystem structure, token economics, core team, underlying technology, and roadmap progress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The underlying methodology involves both quantitative and qualitative analysis to ensure that we produce the most accurate picture possible at the time we conduct our evaluation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a publication focused on assessing the long-term value and associated risks of a token project, we do not encourage the use of DARE as a short-term buy/sell indicator and this report does not represent financial advice.</span></p>
<p><strong>The Initiation Report</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our first look at a token or cryptocurrency employs the Initiation report as a vehicle for delivery. Initiation reports provide readers a comprehensive analysis of the project fundamentals and draws hard conclusions from our assessment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The details of the Initiation report include a project summary, project introduction, presentation and analysis of seven key project fundamentals, concluding with a grade and final verdict derived from our weighted evaluation system.</span></p>
<p><strong>The Update Report</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each initiated token or cryptocurrency will undergo a sequential reevaluation, with Update reports presenting the latest, most relevant analysis on a quarterly basis. The content contained in the update report is confined to analysis of changes in project fundamentals that influence the long-term value prospects of the token or cryptocurrency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Updated project grades and verdicts are provided based on a reassessment of the seven factors underlying our methodology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grades assigned to tokens or cryptocurrencies in Update reports can reflect a change in our opinion of the project or provide a reaffirmation of the Initiation report.</span></p>
<p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We consider the project-asset paradigm from seven key angles: market opportunity, ecosystem structure, token economics, core team, underlying technology, and roadmap progress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The evaluation examines the current state of the project, how it relates to the initially stated goals, and provides an analysis of each fundamental to approximate an accurate outlook for the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These factors are all, in some way, codependent, so they are analyzed both individually and in the context of the overall scope and progress of the project. The evaluation process utilizes a proprietary scoring system comprised of weighted variables based on the follow project fundamentals.</span></p>

			<p><b>Market Opportunity</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to examine the market opportunity of each blockchain project to determine the prospects for future growth. The market opportunity(s) of a given project are assessed according to the addressable target market size and competitive advantages, if any, held by the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The addressable market size is a reflection of the potential number of consumers and valuation of the target industry of the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The competitive advantage(s) of the project and closest contenders both within and outside the blockchain space are weighted heavily in the analysis of the market opportunity. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">addressable target market size</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attractiveness of product</span></li>

			<p><strong>Ecosystem Development</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain projects are highly dependent on network effects. It does not matter if the project is very innovative, if its acceptance in the community and the market is low. This is especially important for network projects that are being built for future dApp development and rely on exponential ecosystem growth for success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We take a comparative look at variables such as number of active addresses, on chain transactions and number of community supporters to determine the health and potential of the ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of existing dApps and quality of partnerships are other variables taken into consideration to assess this fundamental.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of great importance to any ecosystem is the level of decentralization &#8211; to establish this, we ascertain the spread of assets, structure of governance and role of validators in the network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An ideal project will have proven partnerships and active dApps on its network, and a strong community of supporters and developers to foster expansion. The network architecture should also be in line with the target level of decentralization. In its entirety, the evaluation incorporates, but is not limited to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">network analysis (dApps)</span></li>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examination of the token economics begins with a comparative analysis of the project market cap with respect to its relative position to other projects. Analysis also includes evaluating the role of the token, potential drivers of demand, and other factors that may lead to appreciation in value over time. </span></p>
<p><strong>Token Economics</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assessment of the token economics primarily incorporates variables such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">market cap of project</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">role of token and demand potential</span></li>

			<p><b>Token Performance</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we consider price volatility risks associated with underlying asset. Token performance is weighted slightly lower than the other fundamentals because of the more transient and dynamic nature of price movement, volume and liquidity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We look at the price and volume performance trends of the tokens in the context of the overall market, as well as, individual project dynamics. It is important to note that while volatility reflects risk, it is not necessarily an accurate indicator of the commercial viability of the project or long term value of the token. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ideal project will have an asset with positive long, medium and short-term price momentum, in addition to strong, steady volume on major exchanges with a low level of vulnerability to price swings. The evaluation incorporates, but is not limited to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trading data analysis</span></li>

<p dir="ltr">It’s certainly not for the faint at heart, but this Dutch family is showing that by putting your fears aside you can always start a new adventure.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In October 2017, the world was introduced to a family of five, affectionately known as the <a href="https://yolofamilytravel.com/">Bitcoin family</a>, who were in the process of selling everything they owned &#8211; house, car, pension, savings &#8211; all for Bitcoin. Didi Taihuttu, a husband and father of three, even sold his motorbike to prove to his wife, Romaine, he was serious.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They then moved to a campsite in the Netherlands.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It couldn’t have been more perfectly timed. Bitcoin was steadily rising in price during 2017’s bull run, reaching a peak of nearly $20,000 mid-December. It was a heady time to be involved in the space, and even better for a family that had just sold everything they owned.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Yet, according to Taihuttu they didn’t do it to become millionaires, but to change their way of life and to support what he calls the<em> “crypto revolution.”</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“We decided that if we got rich from it we would share it with the poor and that’s what we do at the moment,”</em> he told <em>Crypto Briefing</em>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since 2017, it has been a continual adventure for the family. They no longer live at the campsite because Taihuttu explained they were getting too much attention from the media. At the moment the family is in Thailand, but since becoming the Bitcoin family they have travelled to 40 countries, exploring the acceptance of crypto in all of them.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400"><img class="alignleft wp-image-28511 size-large" src="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BTC-family-RV-1024x805.jpg" alt="BTC family RV" width="1024" height="805" srcset="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BTC-family-RV-1024x805.jpg 1024w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BTC-family-RV-300x236.jpg 300w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BTC-family-RV-768x604.jpg 768w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BTC-family-RV-279x220.jpg 279w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BTC-family-RV.jpg 1157w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Taihuttu, some of the best places for crypto include the village of Rovereto in northern Italy. Here, he explained that it’s possible to use Bitcoin to pay for groceries, clothes, and toys, for instance, with more than 60 shops accepting the cryptocurrency. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400">In Spain they found Bitnovo, a site that makes it possible to buy and sell crypto at 30,000 stores in Europe, and enables the easy purchase of Bitcoin in Carrefour-associated supermarkets in the country.</span></p>
<hr />
<h4>And Then What Happened&#8230;?</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Of course, while 2017 proved to be profitable year for countless investors, 2018 was the reverse. It was something the family felt keenly, losing half of their crypto value in less than two weeks.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“Spending Bitcoin valued at $3,000 compared to $6,000 can make a huge difference,”</em> said Taihuttu, explaining that they had little time to trade as they focused on educating people on how they could get involved with crypto.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignleft wp-image-28510 size-medium" src="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BTC-family-sign-300x286.jpg" alt="BTC family sign" width="300" height="286" srcset="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BTC-family-sign-300x286.jpg 300w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BTC-family-sign-768x732.jpg 768w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BTC-family-sign.jpg 949w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Despite this slump, Taihuttu remains optimistic.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“I still believe Bitcoin will go up again and this bear market will change into a bull market,”</em> he said. <em>“Maybe the market will go even lower first to $2,000 before it climbs to new all-time highs, but in my opinion $40,000, $100,000, and even $200,000 are still possible highs in the next five years.”</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">He thinks that Bitcoin will first become a store a value before it eventually becomes a combination of a store of value and digital currency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Aside from their trading, they also speak at conferences, and have <a href="https://yolofamilytravel.com/shop/">written a book</a>, currently available in Dutch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Considering what the family has learnt now, what advice would they give their 2017 selves? Taihuttu declares he would<em>“Pay more attention to market cycles, hedging a bit more in stablecoins like Pax or USDT to later increase the amount of Bitcoin. Why? Because living on Bitcoin cost Bitcoin and you need to multiply your supply for this.”</em></p>
<hr />
<h4>Bitcoin Living Is Just Different</h4>
<p dir="ltr">For Taihuttu and his wife it’s important for them to show their children that they can still be happy in life without life’s luxuries. They don’t talk to their children about the value of Bitcoin, but rather they educate them on how the blockchain and cryptocurrency are helping to change the world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Homeschooling their children as they travel the world, Taihuttu said that the crypto industry helps with this as it’s a <em>“great example”</em> of how a technology can make it possible to live in a decentralised world with only digital belongings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Citing the lending industry as an example, Taihuttu said that if they want to drive a car they rent one from location A and drive it to location B, paying for the miles driven. Bikes, houses &#8211; rented, not bought.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“If you need a house you use Airbnb or trusted housesitters or hopefully a decentralised blockchain solution in the near future,”</em> Taihuttu added.<em> “We all started as nomads many years ago and settled in cities because of work. Now work is being disconnected from those cities and people can work from home or online. So will part of our society become (digital) nomads again?”</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">While this is certainly food for thought, it’s not going to be up everyone’s street. In fact, since making their lifestyle change, plenty of people have viewed their opinions, claiming that what the family are doing is crazy.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“The worst negative comments are mostly from people that are just too afraid to change life themselves and then trash you for it,”</em> he added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Undeterred from living a minimalist crypto lifestyle&#8230; quite the reverse of the familiar stories of crypto millionaires that have surfaced over the years. And possibly more sustainable.</p>

<p id="788b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3"><em>“Grin empowers anyone to transact or save modern money without the fear of external control or oppression. Grin is designed for the decades to come, not just tomorrow. “</em></p>
<p id="69e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No big promises, no big statements, clean value proposition. Off to a good start.</p>
<p id="d99f" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em>“Grin has no amounts and no addresses. Transactions can be trivially aggregated. To hide where a newly created transaction comes from, it gets relayed privately (a “random walk”) among peers before it is publicly announced.”</em></p>
<p id="b84c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em>“MimbleWimble leverages cryptography to allow most of the past transaction data to be removed.”</em></p>
<p id="e331" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve covered MimbleWimble a few times before in other released reviews, so I won’t go into it to much, if you need a refresher you can look at my <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/beam-code-review-mimblewimble-evolved/">Beam review</a> or my state compacting article.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p id="8949" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">1,856 commits, 109 contributors. I’ll repeat 109 contributors. That is a testament to open source work, no ICO, no expensive developers (and yes, blockchain developers are insanely expensive, just adding the word blockchain to their CV and they up their salary by 300%… that’s a rant for a different day, let’s dig in)</p>
<p id="2c17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rust development language. Normally I would skip the boiler plate, API/RPC/Crypto, but in this case I think it speaks a lot towards the overall project, since the value here isn’t how they do the “unicorn” stuff, but instead how they do the basics.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p id="8228" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Great encapsulation, looking at the code shows equally fantastic abstraction;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p id="73df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Concise, well named and descriptive functions.</p>
<p id="4652" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When functions aren’t self descriptive they add hefty comments;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p id="1203" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Very neat and concise code. I’m going to run through the rest of the boilerplate, but so far it confirms my suspicions, this is a great code base to work off of.</p>
<p id="ff62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">/config/ is good<br />
/util/ is good<br />
/storage/ is good</p>
<p id="95fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A quick note on development. As a developer you often start out with a requirement, and your first code is beautiful, if fits that requirement perfectly, it’s well designed, architecture is solid, just the right balance between abstraction and ease of readability. Then come the scope changes, and additional requirements, and deadlines, and very quickly that once beautiful work of art changes to a horrible mess of spaghetti code.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All clearly defined projects start out beautiful.</p>
<p id="c4d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is a wonderful example of that, the specification was clear, what they wanted to achieve was clear, and the code is beautiful. Will it still be this beautiful in a year from now after scope creep? How will this wonderful code base accommodate changes? I don’t know, I’m excited to see though.</p>
<p id="202c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Wonderful documentation just as an fyi, great place for anyone to start that wants to know more about Grin.</p>

<p>The Zilliqa mainnet went online at 16:00 GMT on January 31st. It includes a host of new features, including sharding &#8211; a scaling solution &#8211; which will be used for regular payments as well as for smart contract transactions.</p>
<p>Based in Singapore, the project has slowly developed over the past 18 months, first as an <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/what-is-ethereum-an-introduction-to-eth/">Ethereum</a>-based testnet, and now as its own blockchain network. Although the mainnet launch was originally slated for Q3 2018,  Zilliqa pushed it back until January. It released the <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/zilliqa-testnet-zil-price/">third version of its testnet</a> back in November.</p>
<hr />
<h4>Sharding works!</h4>
<p>A concept which began in an academic paper, Zilliqa &#8211; a play-on-words on &#8216;Silica&#8217; &#8211; developed primarily as an implementation of sharding technology.</p>
<p>Sharding effectively splits the computational load of blockchain transactions. Nodes establish consensus in smaller groups, making transactions faster and cheaper than if they were processed by the entire network.</p>
<p>Zilliqa&#8217;s development team announced back in April that the network could handle up to <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/zilliqa-closes-in-on-visas-8000-tps/">2,000 transactions per second</a> (tps); significantly more than <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/what-is-bitcoin-digital-cash/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> at 7tps, or a non-sharding Ethereum at 15tps. The network&#8217;s own bug-resistant <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/zilliqa-news-scilla-bug-resistant-language/">&#8216;Scilla&#8217; smart contracts</a> can also use sharding.</p>
<p>In a letter to crypto media outlets this morning, Zilliqa&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, Xinshu Dong, said the launch represents the first adoption of sharding: an important milestone in making blockchains scalable.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Today, we are taking a leap towards our vision of enabling innovative blockchain-powered solutions to real-world problems,&#8221;</em> Dong wrote. &#8220;<em>With this launch, Zilliqa is now the first public blockchain platform to successfully implement sharding, to address one of the biggest challenges to mainstream blockchain adoption &#8211; scalability.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Developers are busy implementing sharding onto Ethereum as part of its Casper protocol, but that isn&#8217;t expected until 2020. <em>Crypto Briefing </em>reported back in July that the Etheremon dApp was considering a <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/etheremon-zilliqa-eth-network-not-ready/">partial move to Zilliqa</a>, so as to lower transaction costs for users.</p>
<p>A successful implementation on Zilliqa could demonstrate that sharding works, which is good news for the crypto-verse.</p>
<p>But for Ethereum it may sound more like a warning. If the original smart contract platform wants to keep its dApps and users, it needs to solve its scaling issues without delay.</p>

It&#8217;s the first time the UK regulator has granted explicit authorization for CFDs backed by virtual currencies.</p>
<p>London-based cryptocurrency liquidity provider, B2C2, announced this morning that the FCA had authorized them to arrange and deal in crypto-backed CFDs through their subsidiary, B2C2 OTC. This means eligible counterparties and professional clients will be able to gain exposure to the wider crypto market through the new B2C2 CFD&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Underlying assets for the CFDs will initially include <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/what-is-bitcoin-digital-cash/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>, <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/what-is-ethereum-an-introduction-to-eth/">Ether (ETH)</a>, <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/what-is-ripple-an-introduction-to-xrp/">XRP</a>, <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/what-is-litecoin-introduction-to-ltc/">Litecoin (LTC)</a> and <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/what-is-bitcoin-cash-introduction-to-bch/">Bitcoin Cash (BCH)</a>. B2C2 hopes to also offer <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/what-is-eos-introduction-to-the-eos-token/">EOS</a> in the near future.</p>
<p>Contracts for difference are commonplace in traditional markets. They are agreements between two parties, in which the seller agrees to pay the difference between an asset&#8217;s current market price and the price at a designated point in the future.  If the value decreases, the buyer pays the seller.</p>
<p>The crypto CFD is not entirely new; other firms offer similar derivative products. But many of these had been created with limited regulatory oversight.</p>
<p>They also had very high leverages &#8211; increasing the risk to investors. For example, Avatrade&#8217;s crypto CFD&#8217;s offered leverage as high as 20:1.  New leverage limits introduced last summer by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) mean that the new B2C2 CFD can only be leveraged at 2:1.</p>
<hr />
<h4 align="justify">What separates a crypto CFD from a future?</h4>
<p align="justify">Like futures, CFDs can be used to speculate on projected prices; unlike futures, CFD contract sizes are normally smaller, making them accessible to smaller-scale traders.</p>
<p align="justify">Whereas the contract size for a CME Bitcoin future is 5 BTC, a B2C2 spokesperson told <em>Crypto Briefing </em>that those for its new crypto-backed CFD can start at a fraction of a bitcoin.</p>
<p align="justify">As a derivative, crypto CFDs enable traders to gain market exposure without needing to own the underlying asset. Max Boonen, founder and CEO of B2C2, explained that this enabled clients to participate in crypto without the headache and potential security risk of a custodial solution.</p>
<p align="justify">“<em>We are excited to have received authorisation from the FCA to introduce a cryptocurrency CFD product,&#8221;</em> Boonen wrote in a statement.<em> &#8220;Eligible counterparties and professional clients can now gain derivative exposure to the cryptocurrency markets, benefiting from the competitive pricing and liquidity they’re accustomed to receiving from B2C2 while avoiding the risks associated with crypto custody.</em>”</p>

<hr />
<h4>ZRX / USD Short-term price analysis</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the short-term, ZRX is bearish and looks set to extend its recent losses. The ZRX / USD pair is posting record all-time lows, while also trading beneath the neckline of a large head and shoulders pattern.</p>
<p>Buyers have twice failed to bring price back above the neckline of the bearish head and shoulders pattern, further highlighting the potential for short-term weakness in the ZRX / USD pair.</p>
<p>Technical indicators also show that the next down move is ready to commence, with both the Stochastic and MACD indicators on the four-hour time frame primed for a move lower.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pattern Watch</strong></p>
<p>The bearish head and shoulders pattern is the overwhelming theme on the four-hour time frame chart, a failed inverted head and shoulders pattern can also be seen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/H4-ZRXUSD-CHART.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-28503" src="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/H4-ZRXUSD-CHART.png" alt="" width="1241" height="522" srcset="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/H4-ZRXUSD-CHART.png 1241w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/H4-ZRXUSD-CHART-300x126.png 300w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/H4-ZRXUSD-CHART-768x323.png 768w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/H4-ZRXUSD-CHART-1024x431.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1241px) 100vw, 1241px" /></a>ZRX / USD H4 Chart                                                                         <em>(Source: TradingView)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MACD Indicator</strong></p>
<p>The MACD indicator has corrected higher, and is starting to trend lower, in line with the recent down move. It is also worth noting that selling activity may pick up once the signal line crosses over and the MACD histogram moves below the zero line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stochastic</strong></p>
<p>The Stochastic indicator on the four-hour time frame has corrected higher and is starting to turn, the indicator also shows plenty of scope to trade lower.</p>
<hr />
<h4>ZRX / USD Medium-term price analysis</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZRX is bearish in the medium-term, with the daily time frame chart showing price trapped inside a large falling wedge pattern.</p>
<p>After recently failing to break above the well-defined wedge pattern, sellers are now starting to take control of price-action, sending the ZRX / USD pair to a fresh all-time trading low.</p>
<p>In line with the prevailing theme of overall weakness, ZRX is likely to fall towards the bottom of the falling wedge pattern in the medium-term.</p>
<p>Falling wedge patterns are statistically bullish, so the ZRX / USD pair should be closely watched for any bullish signals if a top-side breakout were to occur.</p>

<p><strong>Pattern Watch</strong></p>
<p>Aside from the falling wedge pattern on the daily time frame, the November 2018 decline seen in the ZRX / USD pair has triggered a series of bearish head and shoulders patterns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RSI + MACD Indicators</strong></p>
<p>The RSI indicator is turning bearish and shows the emergence of a failed inverted head and shoulders pattern. The MACD indicator is also starting to turn lower, although the MACD signal line is currently neutral and awaiting a definitive breakout in the ZRX / USD pair.</p>
<hr />
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZRX is overwhelmingly one of the most bearish cryptocurrencies among the top 30. In the short-term, another decline appears imminent. In the medium-term the huge falling wedge-pattern is dominating the trading action, range-bound trading action will likely occur if the ZRX / USD pair survives a test of trendline support, as seen on the daily time frame.</p>

<li>Ontology is under pressure in the short-term with price trading near the neckline of a bearish head and shoulder pattern</li>
<li>ONT / USD is bearish in the medium-term with price consolidating at the bottom of a triangle pattern</li>
<li>Medium-term technical indicators are starting to appear oversold</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4>Ontology / USD Short-term price analysis</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the short-term, Ontology is bearish with price now trading around the neckline of a head and shoulders pattern. The downside projection of the bearish pattern would send the ONT / USD pair towards the December 2018 trading low.</p>
<p>Ontology has been trading in a relatively narrow price range since mid-January. The recent decline in the broader cryptocurrency has seen the ONT / USD break below its two-week trading range.</p>
<p>Technical indicators have started to turn higher as the ONT / USD pair attempts to recover from the weakest levels of the trading year so far.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Pattern Watch</strong></p>
<p>The head and shoulders pattern across the lower time frame charts is the most dominant theme in the short-term. A sustained break below neckline support is currently the most favorable scenario.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Relative Strength Index</strong></p>
<p>The RSI indicator appears to be correcting back towards the neutral in the short-term, traders looking to sell the ONT / USD pair should watch this indicator for signs of a bearish reversal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MACD Indicator</strong></p>
<p>The MACD indicator is starting to correct higher, at present no price divergence has developed across the four-hour or other lower time frames.</p>
<hr />
<h4>ONT / USD Medium-term price analysis</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ontology is overwhelmingly bearish in the medium-term and is vulnerable to further selling towards its all-time trading low.</p>
<p>The ONT / USD pair has been trading below its 100-day moving average since June of last year, with traders using any minor corrective rallies as an opportunity to sell into the prevailing trend.</p>
<p>The ONT / USD pair is currently trading in a bearish descending triangle pattern on the daily time frame, with price testing the lower trendline.</p>
<p>Ontology is another cryptocurrency that is on the cusp of a technical breakdown, with any bounces higher likely to be sold lower over the medium-term.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ONTUSD-Daily-Chart.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-28497" src="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ONTUSD-Daily-Chart.png" alt="" width="1241" height="521" srcset="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ONTUSD-Daily-Chart.png 1241w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ONTUSD-Daily-Chart-300x126.png 300w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ONTUSD-Daily-Chart-768x322.png 768w, https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ONTUSD-Daily-Chart-1024x430.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1241px) 100vw, 1241px" /></a>ONT / USD Daily Chart                                                                         <em>(Source: TradingView)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pattern Watch</strong></p>
<p>Traders should carefully watch the descending triangle pattern on the daily time frame as it provides a solid indicator of the ONT / USD medium-term directional bias.</p>
<p>Range-bound trading action may occur if sellers fail to break below the triangle pattern. Moves towards the upper trendline of the triangle could provide traders with favourable scalping opportunities and a better price entry on the sell-side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MACD Indicator</strong></p>
<p>The MACD histogram is starting to recover higher on the daily time frame, while the MACD line is currently flat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stochastic Indicator</strong></p>
<p>The stochastic indicator appears overstretched on the daily time frame and has moved into oversold territory in a relatively short period of time. When the Stochastic indicator quickly becomes oversold on the daily time frame, it tends to point to trend exhaustion in the medium-term.</p>
<hr />
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ontology is likely to trade lower in the short and medium terms, traders are using any technical corrections as an opportunity to sell into the prevailing downtrend. Caution is advised for medium-term as the Stochastic indicators start to show signs of downside exhaustion on the daily time frame.</p>

Binance, the most popular exchange by trading volume, is integrating credit card payments, allowing new traders to buy and start trading on one of the most popular exchanges, <em>“within minutes.”</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to a press release, the Malta-based exchange has partnered with Simplex for credit card payments, allowing traders to use a Visa and or Amex to directly purchase <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/what-is-bitcoin-digital-cash/">bitcoin (BTC)</a>, <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/what-is-ethereum-an-introduction-to-eth/">Ether (ETH)</a>, <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/what-is-litecoin-introduction-to-ltc/">Litecoin (LTC)</a> or <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/what-is-ripple-an-introduction-to-xrp/">XRP</a>, which can then be traded among 151 different altcoins and tokens. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><em>“We want to provide Binance traders with fast and easy access to crypto, in the most secure way possible,”</em> said CEO Changpeng Zhao, in a statement. <em>“Partnering with Simplex allows us to instantly bridge the gap between credit card payments and crypto for traders globally. On <span class="s2">Binance.com</span>, you can now buy crypto with credit cards and start trading in minutes.”</em></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The partnership opens another road between fiat and crypto, on an exchange which remains focused on making it easier for casual users to purchase cryptocurrencies. Last year saw the launch of Binance Uganda, allowing clients to purchase bitcoins and other tokens directly with the Ugandan shilling. More recently, <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/binance-jersey-lightens-the-brexit-mooed-for-uk-crypto-fans/">Binance Jersey</a> opened the door to direct Euro and GBP purchases. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The credit card payments will be facilitated by Simplex, an Israel-based Fintech startup which provides <em>“guaranteed fraudless payments.”</em> In the event of a chargeback, Simplex’s merchant clients are covered by the company—an extra reassurance for merchants worried about fraudulent purchases.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><em>“Easy and fast credit card payments, for mainstream users, is a key factor in wider adoption of crypto in general,”</em> said Simplex CEO Nimrod Lehavi. </span><em><span class="s1">“We’re thrilled to partner up with Binance and together enable a much better, fast and easy experience.”</span></em></p>
<hr />
<h4>Will credit cards push adoption?</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Purchasing cryptocurrencies is still an opaque and challenging process, with many users forced to move funds between multiple exchanges in order to acquire smaller tokens. Even on reputable exchanges, like Coinbase, bank transfers can be slow. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But the latest addition lowers some of the barriers to crypto adoption. <em>“The crypto industry is still in its early stages and most of the world’s money is still in fiat,”</em> CZ said. <em>&#8220;Building fiat gateways is what we need now to grow the ecosystem, increase adoption and introduce crypto to more users.&#8221;</em></span></p>

With more than 20 launch partners and approximately 227K worth of WBTC already on the network, the project may be looking to take the lead over its main competitor, <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/wanchain-wan-token-progress-report/">Wanchain (WAN).</a></p>
<p>WBTC officially became a tradeable ERC20 asset on Wednesday evening. As a BTC-based derivative token, WBTC is minted when actual <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/what-is-bitcoin-digital-cash/">bitcoin</a> is deposited with a custodian on a 1:1 ratio. This allows traders to effectively use Bitcoin&#8217;s value on Ethereum and its dApps, for example on decentralized exchanges.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/wbtc-bitcoin-ethereum-wanchain/">Announced</a> in October, it&#8217;s a joint venture between the liquidity pool <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/kyber-decentralized-exchange-goes-live/">Kyber Network (KNC)</a>, the dark pool <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/republic-announces-dark-pool-platform/">Republic Protocol (REN)</a>, and security and custodial firm, BitGo. A KNC spokesperson told <em>Crypto Briefing</em> that more than $227,000 worth of WBTC had already been minted and made usable, ahead of the launch, to provide initial liquidity and functionality to trading pairs.</p>
<p>Wrapped Bitcoin functions as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), and its members govern and determine any changes to the WBTC structure. Twenty-six organizations are already members, including portfolio and news app <a href="http://blockfolio.com/">Blockfolio</a>, stablecoin provider <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/what-are-mkr-and-dai-introduction-to-maker/">MakerDAO</a>, and payments protocol<a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/what-is-omisego-introduction-to-omg/"> OmiseGO (OMG).</a></p>
<hr />
<h4>Is it too centralized?</h4>
<p>WBTC isn&#8217;t the only project looking to facilitate bitcoin transactions on Ethereum. Wanchain has been developing bridges between different blockchains. The project announced just before Christmas it had fully-launched<a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-meets-ethereum-wanchain-blockchain/"> Wanchain 3.0</a>, which provided interoperability between the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.</p>
<p>Although Wrapped Bitcoin and Wanchain&#8217;s own cross-chain Bitcoin token work on similar lines, and even share the same ticker symbol &#8211; &#8216;WBTC&#8217; &#8211; Wanchain has told <em>Crypto Briefing </em>before that the two are very distinctive projects.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://medium.com/wanchain-foundation/the-path-towards-a-decentralized-financial-system-250e763dc00d">Medium article</a> posted in November, Wanchain&#8217;s technical strategist, Johann Eid, said Wrapped Bitcoins were<em> &#8220;centralized solutions.&#8221;</em> Because they rely on a custodian, Wanchain believes WBTC users still have to trust a single party to hold the deposited bitcoin.</p>
<p><em>“There is a world of difference between WBTC on Ethereum and the one being implemented on Wanchain,”</em> Eid said to <em>Crypto Briefing </em>before Christmas. <em>“Wanchain aims to implement a fully decentralized solution to solve the cross-chain transfer of value challenge, while WBTC on Ethereum is currently operating more like a traditional banking/custodial solution.”</em></p>
<p>A Wrapped Bitcoin spokesperson didn&#8217;t respond to Crypto Briefing&#8217;s question on whether it was a direct competitor with Wanchain, by the time we went to press.</p>
<hr />
<h4>War for the wrapped bitcoin</h4>
<p>The two projects are using very different strategies. Wrapped Bitcoin has hit the ground running with the $227,000 in WBTC providing immediate liquidity. Wanchain is gradually developing and it hopes to have extended interoperability to other networks, <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/what-is-ripple-an-introduction-to-xrp/">XRP</a>, <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/what-is-stellar-introduction-to-xlm/">Stellar Lumens (XLM)</a> and <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/what-is-eos-introduction-to-the-eos-token/">EOS</a>, in the future.</p>
<p>The war for the wrapped bitcoins has now entered a new phase.</p>

As prices continue to slump, lumens linked to the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), the organization behind the XLM network, are making their way into wallets linked to well-known cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
<p>Data collected by <a href="https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/">StellarExpert</a>, a block explorer and analytics platform for the Stellar Lumens network, show the movement of the Foundations&#8217; lumens.</p>
<p>One wallet, which we&#8217;ve nicknamed <a href="https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/account/GBNDKFMGZWYOUA3K5PKSDT677HHQNUM7VFYVAZPJVGA73NXRWSWLGIMC">&#8216;GIMC</a>&#8216; after the last four digits of the public address, was created by SDF Operations in 2017. GIMC has received hundreds of millions of Lumens tokens since last June, principally from another wallet attached to SDF Operations, which we&#8217;ll call &#8216;<a href="https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/account/GBFZPAHO24P7ZVZCMI5SXZR53UYD325OWSSWWHHVLBNN56LU5YZJJFNP">JFNP</a>&#8216;.  For example, on December 14th, JFNP sent 25.4M XLM tokens &#8211; valued at $2.5M at the then market rate &#8211; over to GIMC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_28422" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-28422 size-publisher-lg" src="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/new-e1548858173404-750x430.png" alt="GIMC wallet shows XLM leaving to exchange wallets" width="750" height="430" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Source: StellarExpert</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although GIMC has historically maintained an XLM balance in the millions, throughout the last two quarters it has occasionally transferred large quantities to known exchange wallets. On January 21st, Monday last week, it sent 10M XLM tokens to Kraken and 30M to Binance.</p>
<p>This coincided with a $100M drop in XLM market cap on the same day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_28417" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-28417 size-publisher-lg" src="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/XLM-750x430.jpg" alt="XLM price sunk by around $100M overall on January 21st" width="750" height="430" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">XLM price movements on January 21st.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Is Stellar Foundation Selling?</h4>
<p>The Stellar Development Foundation is a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco, according to its <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=275522707">Bloomberg profile</a>. Since 2014, it has been the principal designer and developer of the Stellar Lumens network.</p>
<p>As with many other cryptocurrency organizations, SDF will likely have significant quantities of XLM in reserve, both to pay its own bills and to stimulate development in the wider ecosystem.</p>
<p>Joe Lubin&#8217;s ConsenSys had to cut down on the number of &#8216;spokes,&#8217; partly because of a declining <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/what-is-ethereum-an-introduction-to-eth/">Ether (ETH)</a> price; ETCDev, the lead developer for <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/what-is-ethereum-classic-introduction-to-etc/">Ethereum Classic (ETC)</a> went <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/etcdev-ethereum-classic/">out of business</a> last year because its operational reserves, held in ETC, collapsed in value in Q4.</p>
<p>The SDF is likely facing the same pressures; market uncertainty and concerns about funding future operations could be putting the Foundation in a financial tight spot.</p>
<hr />
<h4>Don&#8217;t Run Yet</h4>
<p>Conversely, the movements could be grants transferred from SDF to organizations &#8211; 34 currently &#8211; working on the Stellar blockchain. As highlighted on their <a href="https://www.stellar.org/lumens/stellar-partnership-grant-program/">website</a>, the Foundation still has over <a href="http://dashboard.stellar.org">80 billion lumens</a>, 25bn XLM of which are earmarked for  network development. More than 8.6bn have already been distributed.</p>
<p>Funds are held in escrow until projects reach certain agreed milestones. This may explain why SDF funds have dripped into unaffiliated wallets, and thereby made their way into exchanges. Grant beneficiaries may be selling Lumens in order to fund development.</p>
<p>Account &#8216;<a href="https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/account/GA2HP7RN7LWMFHRMTXJMZXQ7NFBQRZG6SIL44SIXYNTTM3E2EJFSTJO4">TJO4</a>&#8216; for example has on numerous occasions received funds from SDF. Most of these funds have then been transferred to exchange wallets. For example, twice last year &#8211; on July 6th and October 8th &#8211; TJO4 received 214,200 XLM from an SDF-linked wallet. Within half an hour, the same quantity of Lumens was transferred to the same Kraken wallets, in two lots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_28423" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-28423 size-publisher-lg" src="https://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/xlm-1-e1548859233584-750x430.jpg" alt="XLM sold in intervals to Kraken exchange" width="750" height="430" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Transactions to Kraken highlighted in red. Source: StellarExpert.</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first transfer, this coincided with slight drops in the XLM price. At just after 18:00 GMT, July 6th, the Lumens market cap <a href="https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/xlm/overview/USD">dropped</a> by around $80M from $3.93bn to $3.851bn. But in the October transfer, there was no such drop, suggesting a smaller effect on the market price at that the time.</p>
<p><em>Crypto Briefing</em> reached out to SDF for comment but hadn&#8217;t heard back by the time we went to press.</p>
<p>Regardless of motive, large quantities of XLM linked to SDF-controlled wallets have made their way to exchange wallets in the past month. Although there&#8217;s nothing particularly sinister about the SDF using its resources, the added selling pressure is unlikely to have helped the XLM market price this week.</p>
<p>That could explain why Stellar Lumens was one of the most affected cryptocurrencies in the top-ten. The coin is <a href="https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/xlm/overview/USD">currently up</a> 3.32% today, while movements from SDF wallets appear to have slowed.</p>
