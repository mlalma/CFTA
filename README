CFTA is a set of Java libraries that ease writing applications
focused on content fetching from multiple different sources (e.g.
Twitter streams, RSS feeds, web pages) and parsing & analysing
the text content using natural language processing methods.

CFTA provides a front-end web API for 3rd party applications 
to access its functionality or the projects can directly 
link and use CFTA .JAR libraries in their Java projects.
